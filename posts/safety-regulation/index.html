<p><em>You might end up being more confused about interventions introduced with an aim to improve workplace safety after you read this than you were before. I share some works (essays, surveys, cross-sectional and time series analysis, and randomized-controlled trials) but this is NOT a literature review—it’s just what I’ve read and what I’ve skimmed. This is not a newsletter but an “open notebook” that I update as I learn. I give some theoretical reasons for why some features in certain regulatory regimes might have some effect but it’s not backed by evidence. This is dangerous territory, so read at your own peril!</em></p>
<p>In the late 19th and early 20th century, many countries adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_compensation">no-fault compensation for workers</a>. This means that employers, except for cases of willful misconduct of employees, have to <em>always</em> compensate employees (barring some exceptions) if they’re injured or they die in an accident at the workplace. The compensation usually covers loss of wages due to the accident and medical expenses but not anything more unlike what the employee might get if they were allowed to sue like pre worker comp days. So it limits but guarantees compensation. Employers usually pay into a state insurance agency based on the size of their workforce, sector and history of injuries. Jason Crawford has an excellent essay, “<a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/history-of-factory-safety">How factories were made safe</a>” on America’s transition to no-fault compensation based on Mark Aldrich’s “<a href="https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/mode/1up?view=theater">Safety First</a>.” I recommend reading the entire essay but I’m attaching some important excerpts here (emphasis mine).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It was difficult for accident victims to gain suitable injury compensation from their employers. Their only recourse was a lawsuit—an expensive proposition, then as now. Payments were often small, sometimes covering only funeral expenses, or not even that. And there were multiple ways employers could escape liability. If the worker had been negligent in any way, this was “contributory negligence,” and the employer was off the hook. By the “fellow servant” rule, if one worker’s injury was the result of <em>another</em> worker’s negligence, the employer was again not liable. Finally, by the doctrine of the “assumption of risk,” the employer was not liable if the accident was considered to be within the expected risks of the job. These defenses together <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1888620/">were known as the “unholy trinity,”</a> and because of them, <strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1026118/">it is estimated that only one employee in eight</a> received compensation after bringing suit against their employer.</strong></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the US, the safety problem was thoroughly explored in a 1910 report <em>Work-Accidents and the Law,</em> by Crystal Eastman (who would go on to become a suffragist and a co-founder of the ACLU). The book-length report was a systematic survey of every fatality and hospitalization in Allegheny County from July 1906 to June 1907. Eastman interviewed workers, foremen, superintendents, and the families of the deceased. She described the accidents themselves, the general risks of the factory, and some of the preventative measures that could be taken. She presented statistics on accidents and their causes. <strong>The fundamental conclusion of the report was that in the prevention of accidents, whether directly attributable to the employer or not, “the will of the employer is pre-eminently important.” Work accidents should not be attributed to “carelessness,” but to the lack of safety provisions, inspections, warning systems, and training, and also to the long hours and great speed demanded of the workers.</strong></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The new system, however, dramatically increased employers’ costs. The price to a company of a fatal accident was raised from hundreds to a few thousand dollars, and insurance premiums increased in many cases as much as fivefold. Moreover, the no-fault nature of the system shifted companies’ focus from <em>fighting liability,</em> in the case of lawsuits, to <em>preventing injuries</em>. This shift is exactly what needed to happen. With this new focus and new financial incentive, companies began to set up safety departments, staffed by engineers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Safety engineering became a thing.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The new corps of safety engineers began fixing the root causes of injuries. They put guards and enclosures around the moving parts of machines. They invented locks for the machines, so that they couldn’t be turned on unless those guards were in place. They created automatic shutoff mechanisms. They added reversing mechanisms to machines to clear jams, so that workers wouldn’t have to reach in and clear them by hand. They designed power levers that pull outwards instead of in, so that if they are accidentally bumped, the machine turns off, instead of turning on. At the Ford Motor Company, safety engineers made improvements to tools, then shared the blueprints with the toolmakers. In time, a market for safe equipment developed, especially as procurement departments started to give preference to tools with safety features. The machines began to come with guards and enclosures standard; eventually, you couldn’t buy tools <em>without</em> them.</p>
<p>The engineers added railings to walkways and built viaducts for workers to cross tracks (rather than crossing them at grade). They added more clearance around machines and rails. They redesigned and rebuilt blast furnaces stronger, to prevent hot-metal breakouts. They found safer chemicals to substitute for dangerous ones such as ammonia. They designed safety apparel: safety glasses, protective gloves and leggings, hard hats, steel-toed shoes.</p>
<p>Electrification in particular was a boon, not only to safety but to factory working conditions in general. Brighter lighting made it easier to see hazards, and getting rid of candles, oil lamps, and gas light reduced smells, fumes, and the risk of fire. Electric motors eliminated the shafts, belts, pulleys and flywheels that had previously distributed power, all of which could trap arms, clothing and hair. No flywheel also meant that a machine could stop immediately rather than taking time to spin down. And electricity allowed the factory to be completely reorganized: no longer confined to the line of the central power shaft, machines could be arranged to optimize the flow of materials. This minimized handling, which improved both productivity and safety.</p>
<p>Equally important to these engineering fixes were education and training for the workers.</p>
<p>[…]<br>
<br>
Companies also established or upgraded on-site medical care. Regular checkups also helped: it was discovered that some workers had medical conditions, and should be placed in less physically demanding roles; many others were found to need glasses, and better eyesight improved safety.</p>

<p>In the early decades of the 1900s, injury rates in many US industries fell dramatically. Data from this period is spotty, but here are figures for injuries per million man-hours from a few different industries, plus the DuPont chemical company (from <a href="https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/309/mode/1up?view=theater">Aldrich, appendix 3</a>):</p>

<p>Not all of this reduction is directly attributable to the safety departments; some of it is due to lower turnover and a decline in hours worked per week. Controlling for these factors, however, Aldrich still estimates (<a href="https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/164/mode/1up?view=theater">p.&nbsp;164</a>) that safety technology and practices reduced injury rates 3.7%/year from 1926–45, for a total reduction of about 50% over that period.</p>

<p>I was wondering what might have led to the addition of the more intrusive regulatory regime of having an agency make rules, send inspectors to workplaces and penalize them for not following their rules even before any worker was harmed. In the US, that was the introduction of the “Occupational Safety and Health Administration” (OSHA) in 1970. This didn’t end workers’ compensation but added additional rules, set by bureaucrats, that workplaces had to comply with.</p>
<p>Workers’ compensation was based on the idea that, apart from increasing the number of workers who get compensated (who weren’t getting compensated earlier due to the costs of suing their employers), the liability that employers would have to face would compel them to improve workplace safety and focus on worker health. OSHA, intrinsicly, is based on the idea that there exists a bureaucracy that can pre-emptively decide what practices improve workplace safety and enforce them efficiently and neutrally across its jurisdiction. This is was significant shift in the way the regulatory state functioned, so I was wondering what led to the creation of OSHA. Did workplace fatalities rise signficantly again in the years preceeding its creation?</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <a href="https://eh.net/encyclopedia/history-of-workplace-safety-in-the-united-states-1880-1970-2/">article</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration#History">OSHA’s Wikipedia page</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration#cite_note-Historical_Work_Safety-5">cites</a> to claim that, “[i]n the 1960s, increasing economic expansion again led to rising injury rates, and the resulting political pressures led Congress to establish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),” does say so but the data it provides doesn’t show anything like that!</p>

<p>Strange. Anyway, I did some more digging to find evidence on OSHA’s effectiveness and I found John Leeth’s working paper, “<a href="https://www.mercatus.org/research/working-papers/oshas-role-promoting-occupational-safety-and-health">OSHA’s Role in Promoting Occupational Safety and Health</a>.” Leeth includes a workplace fatalities time series to show that eyeballing the graph reveals no change in trend.</p>

<p>When I <a href="https://twitter.com/vinamrsachdeva/status/1735298040809087112">shared</a> this with Crawford, he shared Scott Alexander’s <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/13/does-reality-drive-straight-lines-on-graphs-or-do-straight-lines-on-graphs-drive-reality/">blogpost</a> on observing change in trends by eyeballing such graphs and specifically this graph. He shows that the timeseries for transistors per microprocessor, which grows exponentially and is famously called “Moore’s Law” (courtesy of Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel and previously Fairchild Semiconductors, who observed this), doesn’t show any change in trend from the time when laser photolithography was invented.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56614de1-d3b3-498b-8e82-aa37271e4c47_600x508.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This, he says, perhaps is because:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Physical law is consistent with transistors shrinking this quickly. But having noticed this, humans (like the leadership of Intel) commit to achieve it. That commitment functions kind of as a control system. If there’s a big advance in one area, they can relax a little bit in other areas. If there’s a problem in one area, they’ll pour more resources into it until there stops being a problem. One can imagine an event big enough to break the control system – a single unexpected discovery that cuts sizes by a factor of 1000 all on its own, or a quirk of physical law that makes it impossible to fit more transistors on a chip without inventing an entirely new scientific paradigm. But in fact there was no event big enough to break the control system during this period, so the system kept working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a congruent issue, the rate of decrease in air pollution being largely unchanged after the introduction of the Clean Air Act in the US in 1990, he says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>That is, suppose that as the economy improves and stuff, the American people demand cleaner air. They will only be happy if the air is at least 2% cleaner each year than the year before. If one year the air is 10% cleaner than the year before, environmentalist groups get bored and wander off, and there’s no more progress for the next five years. But if one year the air is only 1% cleaner, newly-energized environmentalist voters threaten to vote out all the incumbents who contributed to the problem, and politicians pass some emergency measure to make it go down another 1%. So absent some event strong enough to overwhelm the system, air pollution will always go down 2% per year. But that doesn’t mean the Clean Air Act didn’t change things! The Clean Air Act was part of the toolkit that the control system used to keep the decline at 2%. If the Clean Air Act had never happened, the control system would have figured out some other way to keep air pollution low, but that doesn’t mean the Clean Air Act didn’t matter. Just that it mattered exactly as much as whatever it would have been replaced with.</p>
<p>If this were true, you wouldn’t see the effects of pollution-busting technologies on pollution. You’d see them on everything else. For example, suppose that absent any other progress on air pollution, politicians would regulate cars harder, and that’s what would make air pollution go down by 2% that year. In that case, the effects of inventing an unexpected new pollution-busting technology wouldn’t appear in pollution levels, they would appear in car prices. Unless car prices are also governed by a control system – maybe car companies have a target of keeping costs below $20,000 per car, and so they would skimp on safety in order to bring prices back down, and then the effects of a new anti-pollution technology would appear in car accident fatality rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is true. Maybe the US government timed the possible increase in workplace fatalities in advance, introduced OSHA and managed the same rate of reduction in workplace fatalities. It doesn’t sound very convincing to me but it’s totally possible.</p>
<p>Leeth’s paper had much more than this chart though, including a literature review of 17 studies. They were primarily on time series and cross-sectional samples and measured the association of injury rates and inspection rates, citations issued or the existence of the agency. The results range from “no impact” or “insignificant” to modest reductions in injuries. These studies were obviously more sophisticated than just eyeballing that chart but still could be affected from the decision making of the agency.</p>
<p>We would need natural experiments or randomized controlled trials to actually establish causality. And I found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/app.20200659">one study</a> that exploited one of OSHA’s own programs where they randomly assigned inspections on sites selected from a target list of (non-construction) workplaces with ~2-4 times higher than average injury rates based on its survey. The establishments that they inspected, ~80% of the total establishments that were selected in the lottery, had a 4% reduction “in injuries involving days away from work, on average, during the inspection year and following three years.” The finding had a p-value of 0.07, so not statistically significant but still suggestive. The working paper makes additional claims (a higher reduction in injuries) based on adjustments for control group cross-overs. Arnold Ventures, the organization that funded (?) the study, <a href="https://www.arnoldventures.org/stories/a-randomized-controlled-trial-of-workplace-health-and-safety-inspections-administered-by-federal-occupational-health-and-safety-administration-osha">explained</a> this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This treatment-on-treated estimate [“treated” = selected by lottery, “treatment” = inspection] is conservative in that it does not adjust for the 24% of establishments not chosen for inspection in a given year that were inspected at some point in the subsequent three years (i.e., control group “cross-overs”). Adjusting for such cross-overs is challenging in an RCT analysis because cross-over inspections generally take place in a later year than treatment group inspections, leading to a different temporal pattern of effects. In their working paper linked above, the researchers report treatment-on-treated estimates that seek to adjust for such cross-overs.</p>

<p>I’m not making a claim that workers’ compensation is effective but OSHA isn’t. If I did that, I should be subjecting workers’ compensation to the same treatment of an RCT or a natural experiment. I’m just saying that both do have some, but not conclusive, evidence that they <em>might</em> be working—I don’t know if they do work. OSHA is more intrusive and the fact that no-fault compensation only kicks in if there’s an accident without willful misconduct might mean that it generates less false positives but the RCT also finds no effect on business operations, so I’m not sure if one is better than the other, or if either are better than none.</p>
<p>However, there is a fundamental difference in how the workplace safety regulatory regime works differently in the US than in India (and as a side-effect might also give some hints on why such an intrusive regulatory agency might not have any effect on business operations). Yes, we also have no-fault compensation for workers. Yes, we also have inspectors going around telling businesses how to run “safely”. But there’s one fundemental difference in the power that the agency has. In India, businesses can be shut down, if the inspector deems necessary, <strong>without</strong> a court order.</p>

<p>You may go to court to reverse this decision and continue with your work if you get a decision in your favor but your business will be shut until then. The infamous delays of our court system don’t make this super helpful for the employer though. <a href="https://www.oshaoutreachcourses.com/blog/can-osha-shut-down-a-jobsite-understanding-the-rules-and-consequences/">OSHA does NOT have the power close a business or a job site without a court order</a>. This, at least, adds one more independent person, a judge, with veto power over regulatory action—this might lower the probability of wrongful penalization, if their decisions are independent, but <em>maybe</em> cost of lowering true positives.</p>
<p>The US also has jury trials, which may add around four to twelve (since there might be less than twelve in civil trials and they don’t require unanimity) more people with veto power (they find the facts and also have a veto over interpretation of law via nullification). I’m not sure if they have jury trials in cases where OSHA goes to court to shut down businesses or when businesses go to court to reverse an OSHA penalty but they might have; I’d be glad if anyone could clarify how their legal system works in this regard. I say this because unfortunately, the institution of trial by jury has been subverted in the US too for certain kinds of cases — especially regulatory agency cases, where internal judges, called “Administrative Law Judges” (ALJs), adjucate cases for the agency. When those cases reach a judge, the judge relies on the agencies’ fact findings — the case never goes to a jury. Refer <a href="https://www.thecgo.org/research/substantial-defects-deference-juries-and-agency-fact-finding/">this paper</a> for a detailed breakdown of the history of the institution and also the recent subversion. In 2022, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in the US held that people have the right to a jury trial even when the SEC (their securities regulator) brings a case in their internal tribunal, so maybe we’ll see a resurgence of the institution in other agency cases in the US soon — but it’s too early to say anything.</p>
