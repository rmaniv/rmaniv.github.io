    "text": "1 School Choice\n\nPrivate Schooling In India: Results from a Randomized Trial\nby Alex Tabarrok February 5, 2014 at 7:28 am\nKarthik Muralidharan runs very large, randomized controlled trials on education in India. His previous work showed that performance pay for teachers in India has large and significant improvements on student learning. In his latest paper (with Venkatesh Sundararaman) he reports on the results of The Andhra Pradesh School Choice Project, a long-term randomized controlled trial covering over 6,000 students in 180 villages for four years (2008-2012). The study offered students a lottery for a private school scholarships and lottery winners were compared with non-winners. The results show modest improvements in learning for private school students and big increases in school productivity.\n\nWe find that private school teachers have lower levels of formal education and training than public-school teachers, and are paid much lower salaries. On the other hand, private schools have a longer school day, a longer school year, smaller class sizes, lower teacher absence, higher teaching activity, and better school hygiene. After two and four years of the program, we find no difference between the test scores of lottery winners and losers on math and Telugu (native language). However, private schools spend significantly less instructional time on these subjects, and use the extra time to teach more English, Science, Social Studies, and Hindi. Averaged across all subjects, lottery winners score 0.13 σhigher, and students who attend private schools score 0.23 σhigher. We find no evidence of spillovers on public-school students who do not apply for the voucher, or on students who start out in private schools to begin with, suggesting that the program had no adverse effects on these groups. Finally, the mean cost per student in the private schools in our sample is less than a third of the cost in public schools. Our results suggest that private schools in this setting deliver (slightly) better test score gains than their public counterparts, and do so at substantially lower costs per student.\n\nAs Karthik notes in a Ideas for India short article that summarizes:\n\nSince private schools achieved equal or better outcomes at one-third the cost, the fundamental question that needs to be asked is “How much better could private management do if they had three times their current level of per-child spending?”\n\nIs any economist doing more important work with greater potential for real improvement in the lives of millions than Karthik Muralidharan?"

    "text": "2 Performance pay for teachers\n\nTeacher Performance Pay: Experimental Evidence from India\nby Alex Tabarrok September 30, 2009 at 7:39 am in Economics Education\nIn an impressive new paper, Karthik Muralidharan and Venkatesh Sundararaman provide evidence on the power of teacher incentives to increase learning.  The paper is impressive for three reasons:\n\nEvidence comes from a very large sample, 500 schools covering approximately 55,000 students, and treatment regimes and controls are randomly assigned to schools in a careful, stratified design. \nAn individual-incentive plan and a group-incentive plan are compared to a control group and to two types of unconditional extra-spending treatments (a block grant and hiring an extra teacher).  Thus the authors can test not only whether an incentive plan works relative to no plan but also whether an incentive plan works relative to spending a similar amount of money on “improving schools.”\n\n3) The authors understand incentive design and they test for whether their incentive plan reduces learning on non-performance pay margins.\nThe results are as follows:\n\nWe find that the teacher performance pay program was highly effective in improving student learning. At the end of two years of the program, students in incentive schools performed significantly better than those in comparison schools by 0.28 and 0.16 standard deviations (SD) in math and language tests respectively….\nWe find no evidence of any adverse consequences as a result of the incentive programs. Incentive schools do significantly better on both mechanical components of the test (designed to reflect rote learning) and conceptual components of the test (designed to capture deeper understanding of the material),suggesting that the gains in test scores represent an actual increase in learning outcomes. Students in incentive schools do significantly better not only in math and language (for which there were incentives), but also in science and social studies (for which there were no incentives), suggesting positive spillover effects….\nSchool-level group incentives and teacher-level individual incentives perform equally well in the first year of the program, but the individual incentive schools significantly outperformed the group incentive schools in the second year….\nWe find that performance-based bonus payments to teachers were a significantly more cost effective way of increasing student test scores compared to spending a similar amount of money unconditionally on additional schooling inputs.\nSurprisingly, since absent teachers are a big problem in India, reduced teacher absenteeism per se does not appear to be the primary mechanism by which incentives improve learning.  Instead the primary mechanism appears to be more intensive teaching, including more homework and classwork and better attention to weaker students, this greatly increases the relevance of these results to teaching in the developed world.\n\nAddendum: See also Karthik’s comments on the comments at 26.\n\nA follow-up:\n\nShout it from the Rooftops! Performance Pay for Teachers in India\nby Alex Tabarrok March 22, 2013 at 7:26 am in Data Source Economics Education\nSeveral years ago I reported on a very large, randomized experiment (JSTOR) on teacher performance pay in India that showed that even modest incentives could significantly raise student achievement and do so not only in the incentivized subjects but also in other non-incentivized subjects, suggesting positive spillovers. The earlier paper looked at the first two years of the program. One of the authors, Karthik Muralidharan, now has a follow-up paper, showing what happens over 5 years. The results are impressive and important:\n\nStudents who had completed their entire five years of primary school education under the program scored 0.54 and 0.35 standard deviations (SD) higher than those in control schools in math and language tests respectively. These are large effects corresponding to approximately 20 and 14 percentile point improvements at the median of a normal distribution, and are larger than the effects found in most other education interventions in developing countries (see Dhaliwal et al. 2011).\nSecond, the results suggest that these test score gains represent genuine additions to human capital as opposed to reflecting only ‘teaching to the test’. Students in individual teacher incentive schools score significantly better on both non-repeat as well as repeat questions; on both multiple-choice and free-response questions; and on questions designed to test conceptual understanding as well as questions that could be answered through rote learning. Most importantly, these students also perform significantly better on subjects for which there were no incentives – scoring 0.52 SD and 0.30 SD higher than students in control schools on tests in science and social studies (though the bonuses were paid only for gains in math and language). There was also no differential attrition of students across treatment and control groups and no evidence to suggest any adverse consequences of the programs.\n…Finally, our estimates suggest that the individual teacher bonus program was 15-20 times more cost effective at raising test scores than the default ‘education quality improvement’ policy of the Government of India, which is reducing class size from 40 to 30 students per teacher (Govt. of India, 2009).\n\nIn another important paper, written for the Government of India, Muralidharan summarizes the best research on public schools in developing countries. His conclusion is that there are demonstrably effective and feasible policies that could improve the public schools thereby increasing literacy and numeracy rates and raising the incomes of millions of people.\nThe generation entering Indian schools today is the largest that has ever, or for the foreseeable future, will ever enter Indian schools so the opportunity to raise educational quality for essentially the entire Indian workforce over the next several generations is truly immense."

    "text": "3 “Teacher choice and performance pay”\nOne can think of school choice as a “performance pay for schools,” where their pay is judged by (proportional to) the number of students (or rather their parents) who choose that particular school. Why not also give students a choice to choose their teachers? Private schools may or may not choose to implement such a program themselves but the government could implement it universally for all public schools, where students would have an option to choose to attend any public school teacher’s class, or within public schools, where students would have an option to choose to attend any teacher’s class within the public school they’re enrolled in. Club this with performance pay and maybe it’ll end up improving public school performance and help public schools compete against private schools in the presence of a school choice program? Rahul Mehta had proposed this system long back. In his system, students get to choose their teachers (anyone can register themselves as a teacher) and the government pays teachers directly based on their students’ performance in tests."

    "text": "2 The proposal\nThe idea behind this process is very simple. To generate the seed, a fair (say 8-sided) die is rolled a very large number of times (on the order of 100-1000 times). The sequence of numbers thus generated is fed to a suitable hash function such as SHA-512 for a large number of rounds2. During this process, independent watchers are physically present, and the generated numbers are also publically broadcast. Since the result of each roll is a discrete, easily readable number, there is no ambiguity.\nAs long as the die is rolled with sufficient randomness, it is practically impossible to determine the generated sequence ahead of time. For an 8-sided die rolled 100 times, the resulting sequence has 300 bits of entropy with \\(8^{100}\\) (\\(\\approx 10^{90}\\)) distinct sequences possible. Despite that, once a sequence is obtained and passed through some large number of rounds of SHA-512, the resulting value obtained is unambiguous and can be easily computed by anyone who observed the experiment.\nThere are many ways that this seed can then be used to (for instance) select questions from a large repository quickly and verifiably, either by seeding a pseudo random number generator or even simply repeatedly applying SHA-512 and using a subset of the bits."

In the extreme case, it is possible to design a machine that could roll the die with enough precision to where it is possible to generate an arbitrary random-looking but actually predetermined sequence using the die. Thus, it is imperative that the experiment is performed by a human (or preferably multiple humans), and regulations are placed on the height and landing surface of the roll to ensure randomness.\nAs long as the experiment is performed by a human for a sufficient number of tries and a sufficient difficulty of getting specific values, it will become practically impossible to obtain a predetermined sequence. Due to the use of SHA-512, even a single roll being a little off will generate a completely different seed value courtesy of the avalanche effect. As long as it’s infeasible for a human to land every single roll on a predetermined value, this attack vector is not a concern.\nThe die itself also needs to be independently verified to not be able to assist a malicious roller in obtaining a specific sequence. This shouldn’t be too hard, as modifications which significantly alter its behaviour can be easily detected. Subtle changes will not provide enough advantage to overcome the difficulty of rolling a predetermined sequence.\nA way to make any sort of manipulation difficult would be to have all 100s or 1000s of dice dropped at once (not sequentially) on a cartesian plane and the sequence could be determined in increasing order of the sum of the x and y-coordinates of the spots the dice land with dead heats being resolved by giving priority to either of the coordinates as pre-decided (rbraalih, 2023)."

    "text": "Sometime back, I had posted What does the military history literature say about the effectiveness of civilian ownership of firearms in both preventing and defending invasions ? on r/WarCollege and also on r/progun and received some good replies. I’d suggest you read both threads. I couldn’t find any literature on widespread ownership of firearms helping civilians defending against invasions but recently, I found a great (but incomplete) manuscript, Carroll Quigley’s Weapon Systems and Political Stability: A History (pdf), that studies the history of mankind since pre-historic period till the 20th century (even though the book only covers the history till 1500 AD because Quigley died while he was preparing his manuscript) and concludes that “the dominance of democracy in the 20th century is attributable to the acceptance in the 19th century of a weapons system that favored democracy, the hand gun and rifle.”\nAn excerpt from his other book Tragedy and Hope (pdf) on the same topic:\n\nOn the military level in Western Civilization in the twentieth century the chief development has been a steady increase in the complexity and the cost of weapons. When weapons are cheap to get and so easy to use that almost anyone can use them after a short period of training, armies are generally made up of large masses of amateur soldiers. Such weapons we call “amateur weapons,” and such armies we might call “mass armies of citizen-soldiers.” The Age of Pericles in Classical Greece and the nineteenth century in Western Civilization were periods of amateur weapons and citizen-soldiers. But the nineteenth century was preceded (as was the Age of Pericles also) by a period in which weapons were expensive and required long training in their use. Such weapons we call “specialist” weapons. Periods of specialist weapons are generally periods of small armies of professional soldiers (usually mercenaries). In a period of specialist weapons the minority who have such weapons can usually force the majority who lack them to obey; thus a period of specialist weapons tends to give rise to a period of minority rule and authoritarian government. But a period of amateur weapons is a period in which all men are roughly equal in military power, a majority can compel a minority to yield, and majority rule or even democratic government tends to rise. The medieval period in which the best weapon was usually a mounted knight on horseback (clearly a specialist weapon) was a period of minority rule and authoritarian government. Even when the medieval knight was made obsolete (along with his stone castle) by the invention of gunpowder and the appearance of firearms, these new weapons were so expensive and so difficult to use (until 1800) that minority rule and authoritarian government continued even though that government sought to enforce its rule by shifting from mounted knights to professional pikemen and musketeers. But after 1800, guns became cheaper to obtain and easier to use. By 1840 a Colt revolver sold for $27 and a Springfield musket for not much more, and these were about as good weapons as anyone could get at that time. Thus, mass armies of citizens, equipped with these cheap and easily used weapons, began to replace armies of professional soldiers, beginning about 1800 in Europe and even earlier in America. At the same time, democratic government began to replace” authoritarian governments (but chiefly in those areas where the cheap new weapons were available and local standards of living were high enough to allow people to obtain them).\n\nI also posted this excerpt on r/WarCollege. The top comment seems to be erroneous. I think by specialist and amateur weapons, Quigley didn’t mean to say that the specialist weapons were more complex in terms of their manufacturing or their working mechanism but that they required specialist men to use them. A weapon that is more complex than a spear is a rifle but the rifle is much easier to use, yet much more accurate, than a spear for any common guy on the street who doesn’t have the physical strength and training that spears require. Any other more complex weapons, like a supersonic cruise missile, for instance, are practically useless for maintaining internal order and hence don’t factor in when the question of the system of government is asked/answered."

DDA is controlled by the Union Ministry of Urban Development.\nDDA handles housing, infrastructure, commercial properties, land development, and sports complexes of the city. It acquires vast tracts of land for commercial, industrial, residential, and recreational purposes.\nA survey was conducted in 2014 with the help of National Productivity Council and Geospatial Data Limited regarding DDA administered land in the city. It revealed that around 5,500 acres of land under DDA was lying vacant across the city.[1] This comes to around 85 per cent of the area of Lutyens Bungalow Zone and around 50 per cent of the total land area of New Delhi.\nThe focus of the survey was to protect these plots from illegal encroachment. The survey also found that 298 acres of land under DDA was under litigation. However, there can be a possibility that DDA holds more such land parcels in the city which are kept unused and are locked by the organization.\nThese unused land parcels create an artificial scarcity of land in the city which imposes a cost on everyone. It results in an increase in the cost of land due to which the cost of infrastructure projects also increases. Freeing up all such unused and locked land parcels have the potential of reducing the artificial scarcity of land in the city.\nDetails of Vacant Land Under DDA\n\n\nThe total value of vacant land held under the DDA is about ₹ 11,481 crore. This value is computed using a conservative price of ₹ 4,71,600 with a meagre FSI of just 1. Refer to the map and accompanying table for details.\nExperts have estimated the value of these unused land parcels to be around ₹ 1 lakh crore.[3]. If these large chunks of unused land are monetized then each Indian household may set to gain atleast ₹ 459.\n1.0.1 References\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/DDA-reports-5484-acres-of-vacant-land/articleshow/45052865.cms\nDelhi Development Authority, [“DDA”]\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/DDA-sitting-on-Delhi-land-worth-Rs-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/45172286.cms\n\n\nsource\nFirst of all, the numbers in the wiki’s table and the rest of their text don’t addup. For example, they say they have used a rate of “Rs. 4,71,600” but don’t mention for how much land. If we go by their source [3], we can read that DDA’s then vice-chairman said:\n\nThis is for the first time in DDA’s history that the whole inventory of land, whose worth we estimate to be more than Rs 1 lakh crore, has been compiled and put in the public domain. […]\n\nThis is more than 9 times of what they estimate.\nIf we use DDA’s estimate for the value of the land (which I think they might have estimated using the circle rate), then the rate comes out close to Rs. 43,500 per square meter. This means that these parcels are located mainly in the localities in the circle-rate categories F, G and H. (It is common knowledge that the circle rate highly underestimates the sale price of land and if the land is auctioned, I won’t be surprised if they go for Rs. 1-2 lakh per square meter given larger parcels are divided into smaller ones so as to lower the entry barrier in the auction.)\nSecondly, since then, I think the DDA has updated their list of vacant land parcels that it owns, which you can download from here (click). I say this because my estimate using their list is different (more) than what the wiki says. I have calculated the total number of parcels and their total area by land use in Sheet1 of this spreadsheet. I couldn’t get accurate numbers due to errors in formatting and incomplete information provided in DDA’s list, for example, some parcels had unknown land-use, some has their area in unknown units, etc. But these numbers can, at least, be considered lower bounds.\nDDA owns a total of 4,255 vacant parcels, whose total area is at least 8,683 acres. This is equivalent of ~35 square kilometers or ~2.4% of the total land area of Delhi. These parcels are categorized for different land use roughly in the following manner:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand-use\nNo. of plots\nArea (in acres)\nArea (in sq m)\nArea (in sq ft)\n\n\n\n\nResidential\n1534\n2904\n11752942.32\n126498240\n\n\nCommercial\n333\n1810\n7326796.22\n78843600\n\n\nIndustrial\n405\n591\n2391761.62\n25743960\n\n\nNot known\n208\n273\n1105359.607\n11891880\n\n\nPSP\n245\n588\n2378708.544\n25613280\n\n\nResidential + Commercial + Industrial + Not known + PSP\n2725\n6166\n24955568.31\n268590960\n\n\n[Blank]\n503\n265\n1072132\n11543400\n\n\nCommunity Facilities\n6\n22\n88300\n958320\n\n\nTransport\n31\n59\n236823.63\n2570040\n\n\nUtility\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreational\n36\n515\n2085443\n22433400\n\n\nMutli-level parking\n1\n2\n8040\n87120\n\n\nGreen\n633\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal identified\n3308\n7029\n28446306.94\n306183240\n\n\nOthers\n917\n1654\n6692924.232\n72048240\n\n\nTotal\n4225\n8683\n35139231.18\n378231480\n\n\n\nTable: All of the land in the ‘Others’ category belongs to some Land-use category but had to be kept in a different bin due to formatting errors in DDA’s list.\nIt is also important to note that DDA is ready to re-define land use based on current needs as their then vice-chairman has clarified:\n\nAlso we are looking to redefine land uses. The land use was earmarked a long time ago. Based on current needs, we may change industrial land to residential.\n\nResidential, commercial, industrial, “not known” and PSP (i.e. Public and Semi-public facilities), sums up to ~2.5 crore square meters.\nIf we consider the circle rate of Rs. 43,500 per square meter and a rent rate (cap rate) of 2%, the rent proceeds from all this land will be ~Rs. 2,175 crore per year. (This checks with the valuation of the vice-chairmain since 2% of Rs. 1 lakh crore is Rs. 2,000 crore.) If this rent is distributed amongst all adult citizens (for the purpose of this post, I’m defining adult citizens as registered voters) of India, then each will receive ~Rs. 22 per year; if it is distributed amongst all adult citizens of Delhi, then each will receive ~Rs. 1,500 per year.\nFor context, if we consider FSI of 3 for residential buildings, then DDA is sitting on vacant land that can provide a built-up area of ~38 crore square feet. This is equivalent of ~3.8 lakh, 1,000 square feet flats. This is more than 10 times the annual housing unit sales of the entire Delhi NCR (not just Delhi). This means that it is possible that the real estate market will crash if all of this land is leased and so the rent collected might be less. Later, once this artificial land scarcity is reduced, productivity might increase and land prices might increase. Irrespective of whether land prices are higher or lower than what they are at now, people will be better off either via the rental income they will get or via lower land prices."

    "text": "2 Under-utilized Lutyens Bungalow Zone\n\nThe Lutyens Bungalow Zone (LBZ) is the most valuable parcel of real estate in the country. Located in the heart of Delhi it comprises of 3,000 government properties and 600 private bungalows.\nThe land parcel is actively kept out of reach of private individuals and heavily regulated. The population density of LBZ is just 14-15 people per acre while other parts of Delhi are starved for space with density as high as 1,100 to 1,600 people per acre. [1]\nLand allotment and its utilisation is highly arbitrary and discretionary on the government officials. There is an absence of a uniform rental policy in place for political groups that occupy the majority of the 25 sq. km area.\nIn their replies to RTI petitions, urban authorities have compounded the riddle that how sprawling Lutyens’ estates under government control are allocated.\nAn RTI filed with the authorities found out that the rules of the urban development ministry have been generously relaxed for the Congress and the BJP, India’s two big parties. In 2015, the Congress was served a government notice to vacate all four addresses. In fact, their allotment was also cancelled. Yet, the party remains in possession of all the estates. On paper, every national party is entitled to run an office on government land in Delhi for three years. After that, they are required to shift their work-place to privately-owned space.\nNational presidents of designated national political parties qualify for residential accommodation in Delhi only if they don’t have any other in any other capacity. The BJP has two bungalows in its possession in Lutyens’ Delhi: 11, Ashoka Road, its former party headquarter and 14, Pt. Pant Marg, office of the party’s state unit. Two different RTI responses by the directorate of estates give two different rentals for 11 Ashok Road. The March reply quotes it at Rs 3,920 per month, the April note to as high as Rs 78,921 a month.\nIn another response from the government, the Congress is paying merely Rs 3,920 as monthly rent for 24, Akbar Road. While the Chanakyapuri bungalow under the occupancy of NCP is used as the residence of party office-bearers.\nAs per a government circular of July 31, 2014 no state party is entitled to office space on government estate. However, the NCP, BSP, Samajwadi Party also have their offices in government-provided accommodation. [2]\nAccording to an official at DDA “At the core of the LBZ, there are many ‘loose’ areas, including triangular blocks, barracks, and quarters where proper utilisation of land and densification is possible.\nThe valuation of the 25 sq. km parcel is valued conservatively (u[s]ing FSI of only 1) at ₹ 19.32 lakh crore. [3]\n\nReferences\n\n“HT”\n“India Today”\n[Calculation - Total Area x Circle Rate] - 2,49,70,075.05 sq.metre (6,170.24 acre) x ₹ 7.74 lakh/sq.metre = ₹ 19.32 lak crore.\n\n\nsource (emphasis mine)\nIf we lease all this land and collect rent on it, then using their valuation of Rs. 19.32 lakh crore (which is based on the assumption of FSI of 1 and circle rate of Rs. 7.74 lakh per square meter) and a rent rate of 2%, the rent proceeds from all this land will be ~Rs. 38,640 crore per year. If this rent is distributed amongst all adult citizens of India, then each will receive ~Rs. 386 per year; if it is distributed amongst all adult citizens of Delhi, then each will receive ~Rs. 26,648 per year."

The actual area is ~4800 acres (i.e. ~244 acres less than the area within the perimeter I drew).\n\n\nThe Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has unearthed a whopping Rs 1.63 lakh crore scam related to the Delhi airport land deal.\nAccording to the CAG report, the government gave 4,799.09 acre of prime land on lease to its private sector partner Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) for development of the airport. The land was given on a paltry lease rent of Rs 100 per acre per year for a period of 60 years.\nInterestingly, DIAL itself has estimated that commercial exploitation of the land for 60 years would give it profit to the tune of Rs 1.63 lakh crore.\nIn its report, the CAG has indicted the Union civil aviation ministry’s role in land allocation in a number of places. It clearly states that “the ministry and the AAI (Airports Authority of India) have always ruled in favour of the operators and against the interest of the government”.\nThe loot did not stop at highly discounted lease rent. Despite that unfair advantage, DIAL went a step further and got a post-contractual benefit of levying airport development fees of Rs 1,300 extra for international flight and Rs 200 for domestic journey from each passenger.\nDIAL also mints money from the 5 per cent land it has been allowed to use for commercial exploitation. Hotels, malls etc have been built on this land and DIAL gets a share of their profits.\nMinister calls it ‘draft report’\nCivil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh played it safe on the damning CAG report. He said it was just a “draft report”.\n“It is a draft report. We will cooperate. Let us not level any allegations. We should wait for the final report,” the minister said.\n\nsource (emphasis mine)\nI have not been alble to find any reporting of a follow-up after this CAG report. I guess if the lease was shorter (like 5-10 years) and the rent was as per market rate, it would have been able to generate much more rent but even if we take the figure provided by CAG (i.e. Rs. 1.63 lakh crore for 60 years), the rent proceeds from this land parcel will be ~Rs. 2,716 crore per year. If this rent is distributed amongst all adult citizens of India, then each will receive ~Rs. 27 per year; if it is distributed amongst all adult citizens of Delhi, then each will receive ~1,874 per year."

It borders the localities in the circle-rate categories B and C (Hauz Khas, Vasant Kunj, Munirka, etc) which means that considering an average value of Rs. 2,00,000 per square meter is reasonable. If we consider a rent rate of 2%, the rent proceeds from this land parcel will be ~Rs. 1,618 crore per year.

For example, it clubs Ghana and US in the same category when juries in Ghana are composed mainly of civil servants. Until we have a sort of index which ranks all systems in terms of broadness in selection, randomization, size of panel, extensiveness of use across types of cases, etc., we won’t be able to even figure out lay participation is correlated with those dependent variables.

It describes a progression that began with manually drawing a blueprint of a component and interpreting it, followed by operating machine tools with human sensory feedback. Starting in the 1960s, this process transitioned to drawing and interpreting blueprints, then programming numerical control (NC) machines by feeding them a perforated tape with instructions, with the NC machine performing the machining. In the 1970s, this evolved into the use of computer numeric control (CNC) machines. Finally, in the 1990s, with the development of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software, the process further advanced to creating drawings using CAD software, converting these drawings into instructions for the CNC machine using CAM, and having the CNC machine execute the machining. Each step improved accuracy while also reducing the need for a highly specialized workforce built by passing knowledge from senior workers to juniors through apprenticeship.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Production chain of the missiles that S400 fires\nSubstack (not behind a paywall)\nEven though the post is on why Russia is winning the war in Ukraine, it’s more of a brief introduction to the production chain of the missiles that Russia’s S400 missile system fires.\n\nCasting - pour molten metal into a mould/die. This step is totally manual.\nPressing, forging, stamping - shape the metal with compressive force to increase its strength or give it a desired form. THis process utilizes machines but they’re fairly old and (I guess) not computer-controlled.\nMachining - further remove unwanted material from the pressing-foreging-stamping stage using lathes, milling and drilling machines, etc. This stage is most affected from the transition to digital control, which also leads to asymmetric power among countries, a factor that can be exploited.\nCoating - to cover it with a layer to prevent corrosion, increase surface strength or reduce friction, etc. It encompasses a broad range of processes, some of which are automated, while others are not.\nAssembly, wiring - the least automated\n\nIt’s not behind a paywall and includes video clips showing all processes listed below, so I’d recommend watching them and reading the entire post. The clips have been taken from this video.\nIn a recent Twitter thread, he shared a graph illustrating the difference in importance of various stages in the production processes of the Sineva SLBM at KrasMash.\n\nI don’t know what the y-axis is. My best guess would be that it’s either time taken by each process or the cost. I think it being time is more probable.\n\n\n1.3 Asymmetric geographical distribution of machine tools production\nSubstack (behind a paywall)\nThe assymetric geographical distribution of machine tools production makes it a strategic chokepoint, given its importance in manufacturing weapon systems and other essential goods in the modern economy. The following figures from the piece effectively capture these regional disparities. (Note that it’s clearly visible in all of the figures that India has a very high dependence for machine tools but also that countries like China and Russia, which are also perceived as military behemoths by some, aren’t in a very good position either.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh capacity\nLimited capacity\n\n\n\n\nHigh capability\nWestern Europe, Japan\nUnited States, United Kingdom\n\n\nLimited capability\nTaiwan, South Korea, China (heavily limited)\nMost industrial countries"

Alongside complexity, the importance of that industry for those dominated by that mafia influences whether that industry would even exist in that country in the first place. This explains why, for example, cartels control the entire avocado production in Mexico but not something complex — for something more complex, nerds will have to be accomodated and they pose a threat of replacing the mafia in the dominance hierarchy. In the context of Russia, President Putin’s close associates exert significant control over relatively simple extractive industries. This stands in contrast to the more complex industry of producing mining machines, which is primarily led by nerds who’re lower in the hierarchy and distanced from the administration.\n\nIn the mining business, those at the top of the hierarchy, who dominate the industry, rely on machines produced by those lower in the hierarchy. As a result, they allow these lower-tier operators to continue their operations, as disrupting their supply of critical equipment would be detrimental. This situation can be exploited, for instance, by resorting to importing machines — leading to a loss of business for those lower in the hierarchy and potentially push them even further down. The rise of nerds in the hierarchy is detrimental to the mafia, so they’ll do whatever it takes to prevent that from happening."

Galeev employs the food chain analogy to explain that certain critical technologies, such as machine tools, may constitute a small percentage of the GDP or exports but are crucial for manufacturing consumer goods and weapon systems. These technologies are at the top of global supply chain even though they constitute a small percentage of the global GDP. This also happens in the animal kingdom, where, as you go higher in the food chain, the aggregate mass of the level drops, for example, in terms of aggregate mass, all the grass on Earth is heavier than all the herbivores, which are heavier than all the carnivores.\n\n\n3.2 China’s chokepoints (I guess it’s safe to assume that all would also be India’s chokepoints)\nAn article that Galeev often cites, but did not write himself, is “Chokepoints” on “China’s Self-Identified Strategic Technology Import Dependencies” by Georgetown University’s CSET. This article describes China’s self-identified import dependencies as published in a Chinese state-affiliated newspaper Science and Technology Daily. These range from photo-lithography machines (a more well-known chokepoint for China given the sanctions imposed by the US in the recent past) to aviation design software​ — a total of 35 technologies.

Additionally, I’ve included a time series chart that illustrates the contribution of each type to the total. All the data used to create these charts is published on Kaggle and Github. I recommend viewing the charts here for an interactive experience (for example, you can hover over the points to see the exact (x,y) coordinates, zoom without losing quality, etc), but I have also attached them to this post for convenience."

This would make it about as large as the GDP in 2018 (current prices USD). So agricultural land value is about 1 times GDP. McKinsey’s estimate of the global average land value is about 2 times GDP. I’d request the reader to read my post on MicKinsey’s estimate (everything before the section on their methodology, at least) before they read this post further.\nFor the following two reasons, I think India’s land value would be easily closer to, or maybe more than, Australia (~3 times GDP) than the global average:\n\nIf we take both World Bank’s Wealth Accounts and McKinsey’s estimate to be true, non-agricultural land value of India would be (2-1 =) 1 times GDP while agricultural land value would be 1 times GDP. Given that non-agricultural activities contribute more than 83% of India’s GDP, non-agricultural land value would, I guess, obviously be higher.\nIn a previous post, I discussed Free A Billion Pvt Ltd’s estimate for India’s surplus land held by the government. And I showed how it is, at the very least, about Rs. 88 lakh crores (1 lakh crore = 1 trillion). This was from 2018, when our GDP was about Rs. 183 lakh crores (assuming an exchange rate of 1 USD = Rs. 68). That is, surplus government land was about .5 times GDP, more than McKinsey’s estimate for total (not only surplus) government land."

It estimates the economic rent by subtracting non-tax expenses, a 20% return on assets and the taxes on that income. This economic rent is around 20 times the royalties collected, i.e. only 5% of the rent was collected via royalties. Most of the rent went to the miner while some of it went to the Central government via taxes. Part of the rent might have also been paid as dividends to the Central government (which owns ~60% of NMDC). Note that royalties from sub-soil mineral are owed to the state government and are defined in law."

Now this is the level at which their (US) Army War College is suggesting partial conscription against Russia-China-Iran-DPRK because they suspect high casualties.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine War is exposing significant vulnerabilities in the Army’s strategic personnel depth and ability to withstand and replace casualties.11 Army theater medical planners may anticipate a sustained rate of roughly 3,600 casualties per day, ranging from those killed in action to those wounded in action or suffering disease or other non-battle injuries.12 With a 25 percent predicted replacement rate, the personnel system will require 800 new personnel each day. For context, the United States sustained about 50,000 casualties in two decades of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In large-scale combat operations, the United States could experience that same number of casualties in two weeks.13\nIn addition to the disciplined disobedience required to execute effective mission command, the US Army is facing a dire combination of a recruiting shortfall and a shrinking Individual Ready Reserve. This recruiting shortfall, nearly 50 percent in the combat arms career management fields, is a longitudinal problem. Every infantry and armor soldier we do not recruit today is a strategic mobilization asset we will not have in 2031.14 The Individual Ready Reserve, which stood at 700,000 in 1973 and 450,000 in 1994, now stands at 76,000.15 These numbers cannot fill the existing gaps in the active force, let alone any casualty replacement or expansion during a large-scale combat operation. The implication is that the 1970s concept of an all-volunteer force has outlived its shelf life and does not align with the current operating environment. The technological revolution described below suggests this force has reached obsolescence. Large-scale combat operations troop requirements may well require a reconceptualization of the 1970s and 1980s volunteer force and a move toward partial conscription.16\n\nsource (emphasis mine)\nThe casualty figures are from FM 4-0.\nThat doesn’t make our (post downsizing to half) number look good. However, there are several confounding factors here, the most important of which is the relative power between the countries, India and US, versus their respected non-China enemies (Pakistan for us while Russia, Iran and DPRK for them). The right way to go about this would be to get to a casualty number for us like the US did for them and then determine the optimal soldier count. However, I’m not aware of any such estimation from the government."

Assume a force coefficient of 1.5 in China’s favor, and that’s roughly 12 divisions that India must maintain vs China.\nVs Pakistan, India must maintain 20 divisions for credible defense. Up to 30 for a conventional offense.\nIndia currently has 37 divisions, which is enough for a conventional offense vs Pakistan or a 2 front defensive war, but not both. This fits India’s current doctrine. If India downsizes, it will have to change its doctrine as well. […] I’m assuming a simple 1.0 force coef between India and Pakistan, and an assumption that 10 extra divisions can create a 3:1 force ratio along one corps-sized AOR, which then collapses the Pakistani front in that area and bisects the country as envisioned by Sundarji. Cold Start would have a different force requirement. Not thinking about nukes in this scenario or outside intervention.\n\nThis shows that downsizing to half is not compatible the doctrine of Cold Start (if we want to continue with it). Downsizing would mean that we would have to change our doctrine as well (if we haven’t already)."

In addition to the auction premium, they have to make some statutory payments, which includes the royalty, contributions to the District Mineral Foundation (DMF) and the National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET). The royalty is also paid to the state government, either as a percentage of their sales based on the ASP or some rupees on tonnage-basis, but they are defined in law unlike the auction premium which is the highest bid in the auction.

    "text": "4 How to make sense of the bids\nI’m now going to list some of the answers to the obvious question, “Why are the bids so high — to the level of taking the auction and statutory payments more than the value of the resouce?” that I could find in the paper, from this presentation, from my conversations with Rahul Basu and my own premature understanding of the industry.\n\n4.1 Absorb/not make a loss while following the law\nThe first reason that both the paper and corresponding presentation stress upon is that captive miners can absorb losses in their downstream businesses.\n\nMost [reasons for overbidding] relate to the security of procuring raw materials. The cost of minerals may only be a small proportion of operations cost for downstream plants, but guaranteeing mineral supply would be important to the producers.\n\nGiven that the cost of iron ore for steel producers is only ~10-15% of the sale price of steel, the increase in price due to the higher auction and statutory payments might not be too much. If, for example, merchant miners mine iron ore at a cost of 50 and sell it at 100, including auction and statutory payments, while captive miners also mine at 50 but sell to their own steel plant at the same price (50) and then pay 100% of the 100 as auction and statutory payments, that totals 150 or 50 more than what merchant miners pay. Furthermore, if iron ore constitutes 10% of the steel’s sale price, then for captive miners, the increase is only 5% of the sale price of their final produce, which they can absorb, in exchange for a more reliable supply of perhaps their most crucial raw material.\nThey also stipulate that bidders expect policy changes in the future and just wanted to secure the mines till then.\n\n\n4.2 Not make a loss while not following the law\nIn addition to these two legal ways, I think there are some ways that can actually make mining, even with obligations to pay auction and statutory payments of 100%+ of ASP, profitable but those ways are illegal. I’m not saying that they do engage in such activities or that they will, just that there are ways, that are illegal, that can be used to make their mining profitable.\nOne way in which such bids make sense is if miners under-report the grade of the ore that is mined and thus pay auction and statutory payments on a lower ASP, like what was recently a suspicion of the Ministry of Mines for manganese mined in Odisha. The price of grades vary drastically, so recording sale of a lower grade while selling a higher grade can be very profitable. For example,\n\nThe price of ore with less than 25% Manganese content is ₹3,228 while the same for ore containing Manganese content over 46 % is ₹20,407.\n\nSecond, miners can make up for the losses by keeping some produce totally off-the-books. This is not unprecedented. Off-the-book sales would not attract any auction premia or royalties and the potential higher profits could make the miner profitable overall. I think there’s no need for collecting payments in cash or through a non-banking channel — one can just setup a company that pretends to do, say “consulting,” and ask the buyer to also get into a contract to take the services of that consulting company (maybe through another company). They would then make the payment to that consulting company. As long as the real mineral reaches the buyer either without the administration’s knowledge or with their unofficial approval (which may or may not be in exchange for stone gray or magenta pieces of paper), everything should proceed smoothly.\nFinally, there is a possibility of widespread under-invoicing of sales throughout the industry that is enough to underestimate the ASP. If the ASP is itself lower than what the actual sale price is for the same ore, mining can be profitable even with auction and statutory payments of 100%+ of ASP."

    "text": "In a previous post, I shared findings from Rahul Basu’s research on the difference between the economic rent and royalty the government collected from Iron ore mining in Goa from 2008-12. In this post, I’ll share some more findings from Shalini Saksena (2009) on the difference between the economic rent and royalty the government got from oil, gas and coal production in India from 1990 to 2004.\n\n\n\nFig 1 & 2: From BASU, RAHUL. “Catastrophic Failure of Public Trust in Mining: Case Study of Goa.” Economic and Political Weekly, vol. 50, no. 38, 2015, pp. 44–51. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/24482435.

Maybe it had to do with the sale price of these minerals, or something else. I have a hunch that it has to do with the increasing role of private miners in India but since I haven’t studied that in detail, I would refrain from concluding anything and would reserve this issue for some other post.\nUPDATE (30 March 2023): It is important to note that not all of the difference between resource rent and royalty is privatized. Most of the coal mining and oil & gas extraction in India is done by PSUs who pay regular dividends to their shareholders and whose majority shareholder is the Central government. However, the resource rent is still partly privatized since the Central government owns only ~70-80% of the two major miners, namely Coal India and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. This means that part of the difference between the resource rent and royalty goes to the private investors in these PSUs. In addition, the states are entitled to receive royalty & other payments for sub-soil minerals; however, the part of the resource rent for them is taken by the Central government via dividends. (Here (click) is a discussion that I had with Rahul Basu on Twitter on this, after which I decided that I should add this note to this post.)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Jason Miklian and Scott Carney’s “Fire in the Hole” published in the Foreign Policy magazine is on India’s Naxalite insurgency but it also discusses illegal coal mining in Jharkhand (since it is a connected issue) and gives us some estimates. Even though I’d recommend the reader to read the entire article, I’m attaching the relevant excerpt here:\n\nKumar comes from a long line of Jharkhandi robber barons. In the 1980s, he used his mining camps as staging grounds for stalking the region’s near-extinct Bengal tigers. Today he owns a series of profitable but (by his own admission) illegal coal mines, hidden in the palm forests. Legal mines extract ore with giant machines that carve craters to the horizon; Kumar’s are more like secret caves, the coal dug out of deep tunnels with pickaxes by day laborers working for $2 to $3 a day. He told us his revenues run about $4 million a year, typical for off-the-books operations in a state where less than half of raw materials are extracted legitimately.\nOn July 4, 2004, Kumar was closing out the day’s accounts in his makeshift office at one of his mines when seven female guerrillas carrying automatic rifles broke down his door, forcing him into the forest at gunpoint. They marched him to a riverbed, where they stopped and held a gun to his head. “I thought I was going to die,” he recalls. Instead they demanded $2.5 million for his ransom.\nThrough the night, the Maoists marched him barefoot over crisscrossing trails, until they happened across a police patrol that was searching for him. Kumar escaped in the ensuing gun battle. But after he returned to work several weeks later, Maoist negotiators knocked on his door and let him know he was still a target. So, Kumar told us, he quickly hashed out a business arrangement with the rebels: In exchange for their leaving his operation alone, he would pay them 5 percent of his revenues.”\nThe protection money, like the small bribes Kumar says he pays to the police to avoid troublesome safety and environmental regulations, has simply become another operating cost. Kumar says that every mine owner he knows pays up, too. By his back-of-the-envelope approximation, if the other estimated 2,500 illegal mines in the state are doling out comparable kickbacks to the rebels, the Maoists’ annual take would come to $500 million — enough to keep a militant movement alive indefinitely. “It works like a tax,” he says with a Cheshire grin, “just another business expense and now everything runs smoothly.”\n\n(emphasis mine)\nThis is roughly inline with the estimates I’ve heard from others. My conversations with some of my acquaintances have taught me that their conversations with their acquaintances and relatives working at mining companies (it is important to note the multiple degrees of separation involved here) reveals that only 1-50% of mining is on-books (being conducted legally), which means that the government isn’t receiving royalties for the rest of the illegal mining (50-99% of total).\nUPDATE (26 November 2022): I acknowledge that such estimates aren’t very reliable, so I plan on looking at multiple other ways to estimate the illegal mining activity taking place. This includes looking at consumption estimates and customs data: If one can exploit any one point in the supply chain to find the actual consumption of a mineral, we’ll have a better sense of the level of illegal mining. For example, estimates of cement consumption can let us know the extent to which illegal riverbed sand mining is taking place. This method might not be successful if a lot of illegally mined minerals end up being exported abroad, since they won’t show up in the consumption estimates. But then we could also look up export and import data to figure out discrepancies. All-in-all, I think, without even reading a page of literature estimating the level of illegal mining, that there can be multiple ways to estimate the levels and I’ll explore each in future posts."

In France and the United Kingdom, a residual approach is followed, where the total value of real estate is estimated and then the cost of the structure is subtracted. In the United States, the Federal Reserve and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) do not publish separate estimates for land. The BEA cautions against forming a specific land stock value using the residual approach, because data on real estate stock are estimated separately from the value of structure replacement cost. In such a case, the final value of land could potentially be inaccurate due to source discrepancies. For more on how we calculated land values for the United States, see “United States: Splitting real estate totals into land, dwellings, buildings, and infrastructure,” below.\n\n\n\n2.2 United States\n\nFor the United States balance sheet data, we leveraged the Federal Reserve Board’s Z.1 accounts.[196] They treat real estate as a nonfinancial asset, including land and structures (dwellings, buildings, and infrastructure).\nTo gain more detail, we first estimated the value of land based on guidance and inputs from several papers.197 We separately estimate, and then combine, private land, government land, and farmland.\n— Private land: The Federal Reserve reported real estate stock data as a total of private land and structures as well as structures excluding land. The value of private land was estimated as the difference between the real estate value and the value of private structures.\n— Government land: Larson (2015) calculates the share of total land owned by governments. We applied this estimate to our private land value estimates to reach a value for government land.\n— Farmland: The US Department of Agriculture provided an estimate of total farmland, which we adjusted to nominal prices by applying a GDP chain-type price index. 198\nStructures were then estimated as the difference between published real estate values and estimated land figures. To distribute total structures across dwellings, nonresidential buildings, and infrastructure, we used splits implied by the OECD’s published figures for the United States by sector.\n[Footnotes:]\n[196] “Financial accounts of the United States – Z.1,” Federal Reserve Board, 2021, federalreserve.gov.\n[197] See William Larson, New estimates of value of land of the United States, Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, April 2015, bea.gov; and Joseph B.

Mulhall, Commercial and residential land prices across the United States, Federal Reserve Board, February 2010, federalreserve.gov.\n\n\n\n2.3 China\n\nBroadly, three land types need to be considered in valuing China’s land stock: urban land, agricultural and rural land owned by rural cooperatives, and land use rights. Land stock reported directly in China’s national accounts represents urban land owned by the government that has not been leased but does not appear to include the other two categories.\nUrban land is a government-owned asset and is directly reported along with fixed assets and other balance sheet items described above. Urban land value is based on the total estimate of urban land reserves, for which the right of use has not been yet granted or sold. It is estimated based on the value of new land designated for construction adjusted by a factor of three.[188]\nAgricultural and rural land, which are owned by rural cooperatives in China, are not directly reported in official national balance sheet data. Li and Zhang (2017) provide estimates for this form of land for the period 2007–11 based on the present value of the net output of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, and reflecting a 4 percent discount rate and 40 percent rental rate.[189] We leveraged this approach to extend figures for agricultural and rural land beyond 2011 via statistics on agricultural output from IHS Markit.\n[188] Yang Li, Xiaojing Zhang, and Xin Chang, China’s national balance sheet 2018, China Social Sciences Press, November 2018.\n[189] Yang Li and Xiaojing Zhang, China’s national balance sheet: Theories, methods, and risk assessments, Springer, 2017.\nLand use rights are owned by the household sector and are also not directly reported in official national balance sheet data. Land use rights, granted for decades-long periods by the Chinese government under a leasehold system, constitute a significant portion of privately owned property values in China. [190] We estimated land use rights in 2009 based on a survey by the Chinese Ministry of Land and Resources and then reallocated that total from dwellings to land in the household sector. The share of land use rights from structures was projected forward from 2010 to 2020 and backward from 2008 to 2000 using land and construction price indexes and implied net fixed capital formation in structures.[191]\nPrior to the land use rights adjustment, both dwellings including buildings and land were outliers. Dwellings including buildings was 3.1 times GDP, while in other countries it ranged from 1.2 to 2.3 times GDP. Land accounted for significantly lower value than in most other countries apart from Mexico and the United States. After reallocating the value of land use rights from structures into land, both figures for China were closer to the typical range of values observed in other countries (Exhibit A3).\n[Footnotes:]\n[190] “Special investigation by the Ministry of Land and Resources reveals the ratio of land and house prices to real estate projects,” Chinese Ministry of Land and Resources, Central Government Portal, July 2009, gov.cn. Land use rights as a percentage of property price was available only for 2009; percentages before and after 2009 were estimated by adjusting using the land price index for 2004–11 and the construction price index from 2012 onward. The Ministry of Land and Resources has since become the Ministry of Natural Resources of the People’s Republic of China.\n[191] For the real land price index from 2004–11, see Yongheng Deng, Joseph Gyourko, and Jing Wu, Land and housing price measurement in China, National Bureau of Economic Research, working paper number 18403, September 2012, nber.org. The construction price index is calculated via construction sector gross output from IHS Markit. For the 2004–11 period, the real land prices index adjusted for the consumer price index was used to adjust the 2009 implied value of land use rights. For the period 2012–20, the construction price index was used after adjusting for net fixed capital formation, which additionally contributed to the change in values for the non-land proportion of the property value. For the 2000–03 period, values were based on annual growth of land prices in the 2004–11 period.\n[…]\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Methodology for government assets\n\n— Government accounting varies in robustness by country, which may result in undervaluation of public assets.[183]\n[Footnotes:]\n[183] Most governments use cash accounting rather than accrual accounting, and as a result balance sheet assets are based on statistical estimates. For further information, see Ian Ball and Gary Pflugrath, “Government accounting: Making Enron look good,” World Economics Journal, March 2012, Volume 13, Number 1.\n\nIn IMF’s Fiscal Monitor, they published “Managing Public Wealth,” in October 2018, where they estimate public (government-owned) wealth at “USD 101 trillion, or 219 percent of GDP”, for the 31 countries they studied and the net worth to be well above “well above 100 percent of GDP.”\n\nThis shows that McKinsey’s estimate, which puts government net worth well below 100% of GDP, at about 40% of GDP for the world, might be conservative."

In June, the number remained high at more than 20 million barrels.\n\nIf we take the sum of these per day figures from Vortexa and multiply it by 30, we get 21 million, roughly consistent with Refinitiv’s figure but 3 million short.

I’m attaching some relevant tables from the report here:\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Kundu (2014)\n\nNow, of course, the market value of minerals changes, so does their extraction cost (which also converts resources into reserves and vice-versa) and we are also exploring — i.e. these numbers will change and entail inaccuracy but they at least give us a ballpark for what we have: Rs. 5,011.6 lakh crore worth of mineral reserves.\nUPDATE (January 9, 2024): I don’t think adding the value of all identified mineral reserves at current market price is the right way to look at mineral wealth.

    "title": "Misallocation of capital as a result of high property prices",
    "section": "",
    "text": "“How high property prices can damage the economy,” published in The Economist on July 28, 2022, mentions several papers showing how high land values lead to misallocation of capital from productive (or relatively more productive) investment to real estate speculation or to firms with more land to put up as collateral (but which are relatively less productive). Here’s a relevant excerpt from the article:\n\nBut the use of land as collateral has harmful effects, too, especially in places where banks play a big role in financing companies. Firms’ ability to borrow tends to be determined by their existing assets, rather than their productive potential. And those that own land find it much easier to borrow from banks than those, say, with lots of intangible assets. A paper published in 2018 by Sebastian Doerr of the Bank for International Settlements found that listed American firms with more property collateral were able to borrow and invest more than their competitors, even though they were less productive. These effects were also evident in Spain just before the global financial crisis. In research published last year, Sergi Basco of Universitat Barcelona and David Lopez-Rodriguez and Enrique Moral-Benito of the Bank of Spain noted that property-owning manufacturers in the country tended to receive more bank credit than other firms.\nRising property prices can also discourage productive lending, and lead to capital being misallocated. When housing markets boom, banks tend to engage in more mortgage lending. But because lenders face capital constraints, this is often accompanied by reduced lending to businesses. The effect is illustrated by research published in 2018 by Indraneel Chakraborty of the University of Miami, Itay Goldstein of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Andrew MacKinlay of Virginia Tech. The paper, which looks at data from America between 1988 and 2006, found that a one-standard-deviation increase in house prices in areas where a bank has branches reduced lending growth to firms that borrow from the same bank by 42%. The total investment undertaken by the affected firms fell by 21%. Such crowding-out effects may have been sizeable in other places too, considering that banks around the rich world have sharply increased their mortgage lending. Across 17 advanced economies, mortgages’ share of total bank loans climbed from 32% in 1952 to 58% in 2016 (the latest year for which data are available).\nWhatever the effects of high land prices in the West, the scale of the problem in China appears even bigger, given that the country’s investors have a huge appetite for real estate. A range of recent research suggests that China’s high land prices shift bank lending away from land-light manufacturers and reduce spending on research and development by listed firms; they also appear to lead to a reallocation of managerial talent towards the property sector. One especially striking result comes from a paper published in 2019 by Harald Hau of the University of Geneva and Difei Ouyang of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, brd on data from manufacturers in 172 Chinese cities. It concludes that a 50% increase in property prices would raise borrowing costs, reduce investment and productivity, and result in a 35.5% decline in the firms’ value-added output.\n\nThe papers mentioned are:\n\nDoerr, Sebastian (2018).

Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4003834 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4003834\n\nLater on, they also mention how a Land Value Tax can cure this!\n\nA more ambitious idea would be to tax land values, which, by lowering the market value of land, might reduce its attractiveness as collateral. Such a tax was, funnily enough, the goal of many 18th- and 19th-century reformers as they sought a more equal society. A new obsession with land could well revive an old idea.\n\nElsewhere (before these excerpts), they also say:\n\nReal estate is the largest asset class in the world. In 2020 it made up around 68% of the world’s non-financial assets (which includes plant and machinery as well as intangibles, such as intellectual property). Land, rather than the structures built on top of it, accounts for slightly over half of that 68%. As values have ballooned, the share of land in non-financial assets has increased sharply in some countries (though few report the data). In Britain, for instance, it went from 39% in 1995 to 56% in 2020.\n\nThis is from McKinsey’s “The rise and rise of the global balance sheet.” See this for their methodology."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s a theory that attempts to discredit the four former Prime Ministers–Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee–while being overly sympathetic to P. V. Narasimha Rao for their role in establishing our nuclear deterrent. I’d suggest you read this thread by the anonymous Twitter account @arya_amsha to know what the theory is before reading what I think about it.\nAs I expected while going through the thread, this narrative selectively uses screenshots from Vipin Narang’s book, “Seeking the Bomb: Strategies of Nuclear Proliferation.” I encourage you to read the relevant section from Chapter 3 of the book. For those who do not have access to the book, you can find the relevant chapter here on Imgur.\nHaving read this, you may have already identified some issues with arya_amsha’s interpretations. I will now enumerate the errors I found.\nThe author cites an anonymous source to claim that Indira Gandhi was disinterested in developing a nuclear bomb. However, the author himself acknowledges that the initiatives of Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi in starting the ‘Peaceful Nuclear Explosion’ (PNE) program could well have been a euphemism implying, ‘we also have the capability for a bomb.’ This interpretation aligns with the broader discourse surrounding the PNE during that era. If Indira Gandhi was indeed opposed to the idea of a nuclear bomb, why then did she initiate the development of the Prithvi missile, capable of delivering a nuclear warhead? This contradiction remains unaddressed.\nGranted, India could (and arguably should) have pursued a more assertive nuclear policy. Nevertheless, it is peculiar that arya_amsha extends the benefit of the doubt to P. V. Narasimha Rao for not conducting nuclear tests–despite possessing the capability–citing unsubstantiated (in my view) claims of a frail economy in 1994, compared to 1998 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee authorized the tests. The onus is on the author and/or arya_amsha to substantiate claims regarding the economic conditions of the respective years. I am not trained in economics, I’ve only eyeballed some charts on World Bank’s website, namely GDP per capita growth, unemployment, inflation and current account balance, net trade in goods and servives, net financial account and foreign exchange reserves for our balance of payments situation, and I don’t notice much of a difference.\nEven if we were to accept the premise that the economy was weaker in 1994 than in 1998, it is inconsistent for arya_amsha not to afford the same consideration to Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, and Rajiv Gandhi. They too faced the threat of sanctions but collectively achieved a state of readiness for a nuclear test within 100 days, initiated efforts to reduce this to just three days, and developed the Prithvi & Agni missiles for nuclear delivery, as Vipin Narang himself acknowledges.\nAnother excuse for not criticizing P. V. Narasimha Rao’s inaction posits that when he was ‘set to test,’ the Americans discovered the plan, contacted him, and publicized the attempt to discourage it. However, this argument loses credibility for several reasons. Both Vajpayee and Narasimha Rao were aware of the potential repercussions of a nuclear test, regardless of American knowledge. Yet, one proceeded while the other abstained. Furthermore, the Americans themselves lacked concrete evidence of India, under Rao’s administration, contemplating a nuclear test. For more context, refer to this article from The National Security Archive at The George Washington University.\nConsidering all these factors, I am inclined to believe that the only plausible explanation is a lack of resolve on P. V. Narasimha Rao’s part, in contrast to Vajpayee’s determination."

    "title": "Is MiG-21 really the ‘flying coffin’?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "TLDR: I think we need more empirical evidence than we have currently although there may be design choices that are apparent to someone with technical know-why that I don’t have.\nThe Indian news media comfortably describes the MiG-21, specifically and no other aircraft, as a “flying coffin”. It is a term used pejoratively for an aircraft that has a poor safety track record due to specific aspects of design and engineering. There are several reasons for which one may believe the MiG-21 has a poor safety record because of its vintage design.\nRajat Pandit writes in the Times of India\n\nWithout modern systems like FADEC (full authority digital electronic controls) and mission computers, the ageing MiG-21s also have the highest landing and take-off speed in the world at 340 mph.\n\nHe also attributes the poor safety record to issues not related to the design of the aircraft but\n\ninadequate training to rookie pilots, shoddy maintenance and poor quality control of spares.\n\nu/barath_s as adds that since it is a single engine aircraft, it does not have\n\n[…] much backup in case of bird strike or fuel line manufacturing flaw.\n\nRetired squadran leader and jaguar pilot Vijainder Kumar Thakur believes,\n\n[…] the number of sorties flown has an impact on the accident rate. For every 200 flight hour, the MiG 21 likely logs double the number of landings as compared to Mirage, because of the MiG’s much lower endurance.\n\nWhile there are many reasons one might consider it to be a safe candidate for being termed as a flying coffin, I think anyone studying this issue seriously should be asking two questions: 1) Is there any empirical basis to believe that MiG-21’s accident frequency is higher than other aircraft in IAF’s fleet? 2) How many of MiG-21’s excess accidents when compared with other aircraft in IAF’s fleet are not explained by confounding factors like their aggregate flying hours, flight conditions, differential training/maintenance/spare part quality or due to some unexplainable reason other than the design (random variation)?\nI did some calculations on some not-so-reliable numbers to find out accident rate of IAF’s fleet. I sourced data mainly from Bharat Rakshak’s database (accidents, census) but also from Wikipedia (historical, active) and a couple of other secondary sources (India Today and WION). Here is the spreadsheet with all figures and corresponding sources. These charts illustrate some of the results:\n\nIt should be pretty obvious that one shouldn’t compare aircraft by their raw accident numbers since they contribute to the IAF fleet in different proportions. So the next obvious number to look at would be the census (present and historical) of each of these aircrafts in IAF.\n\nIt’s clear that those aircraft which had more accidents also form a larger part of IAF’s fleet. To know by how much, we can find what percentage are accidents of their census.\n\nMiG-21’s accident rate, considering India Today’s accident figure, puts it significantly higher than other MiGs and also the Mirage 2000 for sure, 15 to 39% higher than other MiGs and 84% higher than Mirage 2000, while if I consider BRF’s it is -6 to 13% higher than other MiGs and 40% higher than the Mirage 2000 (so not that different from other MiGs per BRF’s). But something more important to note here is that the last chart, which plots accident rate, is much more flatter than the first one, which plotted number of accidents. It is also interesting to note that such discrepancies exist among other aircrafts too. For example, it seems that the Su-30 has similar number of accidents (11) as the Mirage 2000 (13), even though IAF has 5 times Su-30s as Mirage 2000s. Moreover, if someone was being honest they would call the entire fleet of IAF a flying coffin except Su-30.\nThere are several other confounding factors that I listed earlier for which data in unavailable and so can’t be used to adjust the accident rate or be privy to the entire context. Amongst the factors I listed earlier, aggregate flying hours and flight conditions would not be available due to security reasons possibly (or some other reason I’m not aware of) and differential training/maintenance/spare part quality is not quantifiable. In the absence of this, in my view, vital information, I believe it would be 1) inappropriate to conclude that there are empirical reasons to believe that MiG-21’s higher accident rate is due to its vintage design even though there may be theoretical reasons to believe that and 2) impossible to find out how many of those excess accidents are attributable to its design. However, it is clear that most of MiG-21’s accidents can be explained by the fact that it contributes more to IAFs fleet: 25% of Mirage 2000s and 35% of MiG-29s have ended up in accidents while this figure for MiG-21s sits at 46%, considering India Today’s accident figure (which is more recent), and 35%, considering BRF’s. All other aircraft except Su-30, Hart and Audax are also in that range."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many think that judges are kind of powerless in certain stages of the criminal justice procedure and even if the judge is competent and non-corrupt, they can’t do much because the police and prosecutors have to be competent and non-corrupt as well — what if the police refuses to register an FIR? what if the police does not conduct the investigation properly? what if the prosecutor doesn’t present a crucial witness? etc. While I have no issues in attempting to solve the problems in our police and prosecution, I think Indian judges have vast powers and are almost like part-time police officers and prosecutors. They can direct police to register an FIR. They can monitor and supervise police investigation. They can take up cases suo-moto (by themselves). They consult DMs while they are deciding who can be a prosecutor. They can allow the victim to have private prosecution. They can summon any person as a witness and examine any person in court if they don’t like the way the prosecutor is examining them. Essentially, judges are not bottlenecked by the competence and corruption of the police and prosecutors.\nI’m listing the relevant powers based on the limited information I have about our criminal justice system. If you’re aware of any that are not listed below, it’d great if you could let me know or if anything, that I included, does not apply. (Some powers might be limited to certain judges only.)\n\n0.0.1 1. Registering FIR\nIf the police is not registering FIR or not starting the investigation, the Magistrate can order them to do so. One can directly go to the Magistrate with a complaint of a cognizable offense and the Magistrate can direct the police to register an FIR and investigate the matter.\n\nSection 156. Police officer’s power to investigate cognizable case.\n\nAny officer in charge of a police station may, without the order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII.\nNo proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in question on the ground that the case was one which such officer was not empowered under this section to investigate.\nAny Magistrate empowered under section 190 may order such an investigation as above- mentioned.\n\n\nSection 156 of CrPC\n\n\n0.0.2 2. Monitoring and supervising police investigation\nHC and SC judges can monitor and supervise police investigation. The Hindu reports on an SC judgement:\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that higher courts can monitor the progress of investigation in criminal cases if it is found that influential persons are trying to impact the course of justice.\nA Bench of Justices Altamas Kabir and Cyriac Joseph rejected the argument of some accused persons in a criminal case that courts have no power to monitor investigations as it amounted to usurping the role of the investigating agencies.\n\n\n\n0.0.3 3. Suo-moto case\nSC judges can start a case without complainer filing the complaint. See this and this. Here’s an excerpt from the first link:\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has often taken up cases ‘suo moto’. This means they take up cases by their own notice, without any petition being filed, or interest being brought before them.\nWhile such a power is granted by s. 23 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 for contempt of court, the use of the procedure in writ or judicial review jurisdiction has been novel. It developed from the relaxation of procedure when considering PILs. The first instance is often considered to be in the Sunil Batra case. The procedure for suo moto petitions was formalised only in 2014 by the adoption of Order 38, Rule 12(1)(a) in the Supreme Court Rules, 2013.\n\n\n\n0.0.4 4. Preparing list of prosecutors\nDM prepares list of prosecutors after consultation with Sessions Judge.\n\nSection 24. Public Prosecutors.\n\nThe District Magistrate shall, in consultation with the Sessions Judge, prepare a panel of names of persons, who are, in his opinion fit to be appointed as Public Prosecutors or Additional Public Prosecutors for the district.\nNo person shall be appointed by the State Government as the Public Prosecutor or Additional Public Prosecutor for the district unless his name appears in the panel of names prepared by the District Magistrate under sub-section (4).\n\n\nSection 24 of CrPC\n\n\n0.0.5 5. Private prosecution\nMagistrate can allow victim to have private prosecution if public prosecutors are misfit.\n\nSection 302. Permission to conduct prosecution.\n\nAny Magistrate inquiring into or trying a case may permit the prosecution to be conducted by any person other than a police officer below the rank of Inspector; but no person, other than the Advocate General or Government Advocate or a Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor, shall be entitled to do so without such permission: Provided that no police officer shall be permitted to conduct the prosecution if he has taken part in the investigation into the offence with respect to which the accused is being prosecuted.\nAny person conducting the prosecution may do so personally or by a pleader.\n\n\nSection 302 of CrPC\n\n\n0.0.6 6. Summoning and examining witness\nJudges can call any person as a witness even if prosecutor doesn’t want to present that person as a witness and themselves examine any witness if prosecutor is not “asking the right questions” as per the judge.\n\nSection 311. Power to summon material witness, or examine person present. Any Court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code, summon any person as a witness, or examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or. recall and re- examine any person already examined; and the Court shall summon and examine or recall and re- examine any such person if his evidence appears to it to be essential to the just decision of the case.\n\nSection 311 of CrPC"

For instance, a number of African economies, persuaded to base their entire economy on a single good in which they had a comparative advantage (e.g, gold, cocoa, oil, or bauxite), saw their economies crash when the price of that commodity fell. People who had formerly been largely self-sufficient found themselves wage laborers for multinationals in good times, and dependents on foreign charity during bad times.\nWhile the case for extreme specialization in production collapses merely by letting prices vary, it gets even worse for the “just specialize in the single thing you do best” folks once we add in considerations of pandemics, wars, extreme climate change, and other such shocks. We have just witnessed how relying on China for such a high percentage of our medical supplies and manufacturing has proven unwise when faced with an epidemic originating in China.\nOn a smaller scale, the great urban theorist Jane Jacobs stressed the need for economic diversity in a city if it is to flourish. Detroit’s over-reliance on the automobile industry, and its subsequent collapse when that industry largely deserted it, is a prominent example of Jacobs’ point. And while Detroit is perhaps the most famous example of a city collapsing due to over-specialization,it is far from the only one."

    "text": "3 Solution - be exposed to random shocks\nNorman and Callahan talk about a solution to this problem inspired by “chaos engineering” tools which are often used in the tech industry. They describe the concept using Netflix’s Chaos Monkey as an example:\n\nOn April 21, 2011, the region of Amazon Web Services covering eastern North America crashed. The crash brought down the sites of large customers such as Quora, Foursquare, and Reddit. It took Amazon over a week to bring its system fully back online, and some customer data was lost permanently.\nBut one company whose site did not crash was Netflix. It turns out that Netflix had made themselves “antifragile” by employing software they called “Chaos Monkey,” which regularly and randomly brought down Netflix servers. By continually crashing their own servers, Netflix learned how to nevertheless keep other portions of their network running. And so when Amazon US-East crashed, Netflix ran on, unfazed.\n\nNorman and Callahan address the concern that the act of countries subjecting flow of goods to random shocks, or for that matter any type of shock in terms of banning trade, in the present state of affairs presents an institutional barrier.\n\nIf Freedonia suddenly bans the import of goods from Ruritania, even for a week, Ruritania is likely to regard this as a “trade war,” and may very well go to the WTO and seek relief. However, the point of this reorientation of trade policy is not to promote hostility to other countries, but to make one’s own country more resilient.\n\nBut they offer a solution that will allow countries to implement their solution without violating any WTO obligations or retaliation by other countries:\n\nA possible solution to this problem is that a national government could periodically, at random times, buy all of the imports of some good from some other country, and stockpile them. Then the foreign supplier would have no cause for complaint: its goods are still being purchased! But domestic manufacturers would have to learn to adjust to a disappearance of the supply of palm oil from Indonesia, or tin from China, or oil from Norway.\n\nI guess a country can devise a procedure similar to the following to avoid rent-seeking as much as possible:\n\nPre-decide the frequency and extent of these shocks, while keeping them as “good agnostic” as possible (without leading to something to the tune of self-inflicted extinction).\nGenerate a random seed, using a publicly verifiable process, that can be fed into RNGs to select the number of goods and countries to be subject to the supply shock, the exact goods and countries to be selected and the extent of the government buyout per good or country."

    "text": "2 Sortition used by Tribals in Jharkhand\nThe findings of social anthropologist Alpa Shah reveal how tribals select their community leaders. (h/t Rahul Basu) I’m attaching an excerpt from one of her articles in the Hindustan Times, which describes how sortition was practiced and the roles of the leaders selected by it.\n\nI first saw it in December 2000, less than a month after Jharkhand became a separate state, in the Munda tribe village, where I was staying as a social anthropologist. They were selecting their new pahan and paenbharra, who presided over secular and sacred village matters, for three years.\nA man with a “light shadow” was blindfolded. He carried a winnowing basket on the edge of a pole, and was possessed by the village spirit, Sarna-mai. Shaking while he walked, as if he was being led by the spirit, he wandered from house to house, before eventually settling at one. He stopped shaking, an indication that Sarna-mai has chosen that house as the next pahan. The process was repeated for the paenbharra.\nA few years later, I stumbled across another selection in the neighbouring village. There, instead of wandering across the village, a man with a “light shadow” stood blindfolded in the middle of a large circle of stones. Each stone represented a household. Once possessed, the man went around round the circle until Sarna-mai settled at one of the stones: It was the house that will send the next pahan or paenbharra. A random choice, these villages seemed to be practising a form of ancient Athenian democracy — with a tribal twist.\nI tried tracing the local history of the pahans and paenbharras. Although many complained that the process has become corrupt in some villages, and that women did not seem to serve the roles, I could find no other pattern to who was chosen in these two villages. Instead, I found instances of selected households passing on the responsibility to others if they felt they could not fulfil it.\nThe roles did carry real responsibilities. Apart from propitiating the deities to ensure the village’s safety from droughts, disease and other calamities, the pahan and paenbharra coordinated the villagers to settle their disputes. They had to feed the entire village at least three times a year, and always maintain extra supplies as a social security net for the poor. For that purpose, they were assigned special lands and seven helpers to cultivate it for the duration of their role. In the colonial land settlement records, I found that the Adivasi rebellions had forced the British to recognise the values of these local democratic traditions. Across the 114 villages of that block I stayed in, their records show the method of selecting the local leaders and the lands reserved for the roles.\n\n(emphasis mine)"

For reference, the total area of Delhi is 1,483 square kilometers. So the Central government owns land equal to ~9 Delhi’s. Note that the 13,505 square kilometer figure given by the government still misses 10 Union ministries, some MoD land (for security reasons), more than 280 Central PSEs and all the land owned by State governments, so total government land will be more than 13,505 square kilometers.\nFor context, Free A Billion gave sources for 383,331 acres of surplus land belonging to the Central government. That comes out to be around 1551 square kilometers, which is around 11.5% of the total land declared by the Central government.\nNow The Hindu reports that according to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India:\n\nThe Ministries of Railways and Defence, respectively, have 43,000 hectares and 32,780 hectares of land lying vacant, without even any proposed use […] the 13 major port trusts have 14,728 hectares of land lying idle.\n\n\n\nsource: The Hindu\n\nTo be consistent with the units I have been using, the Ministry of Railways has 430 square kilometers, Ministry of Defense has 327.8 square kilometers and the port trusts have 147.28 square kilometers of idle land. This totals to 905.08 square kilometers, or 6.7% of total declared land of the Central government (13,505 square kilometers). This is a little more than half of the surplus land for which Free A Billion gave its sources. I couldn’t find enough time to dig through CAG reports to find if it has figures for surplus land under other departments. I might do it for a future post but there are reasons to believe that Free A Billion isn’t overestimating the total surplus land (rather underestimating):\nWe can convert the surplus land of the Port Trusts (of 13 major ports I believe) given in hectares to acres. It comes out to be ~35,968 acres. But Free A Billion identified only 27,379 acres as surplus. If we visit their page on Port Trusts, we can see that they have given a breakdown for 10 ports, so it is possible that the rest of the surplus land identified by CAG is either of the remaining 3 (major) ports or some extra in any of these 10 ports. But what is clear is that that Free A Billion could be underestimating the total surplus land."

    "text": "3 Value of the surplus land\nUsing the figures for which Free A Billion have given sources, we can calculate the average value of land. It comes out to be ~Rs. 4,100 per square feet for Central government land identified and ~Rs. 4,300 per square feet for State government land identified excluding Odisha Revenue Board. I excluded Odisha Revenue Board because it is an outlier since has more than 50% of the total land identified but is valued at much less than 1% of the total value but if you include it, the value of State government land will be ~Rs. 700 per square feet.\nIf I take the average value of surplus government land to be Rs. 4,000 (which seems reasonable), the Central and State governments would have to own ~7,800 square kilometers to get the total value of surplus government land at Rs. 340 lakh crore. This is around 8 times the surplus land identified by CAG and around 2 times the surplus land for which Free A Billion have given sources including Odisha Revenue Board but 4 times if we exclude Odisha Revenue Board. It is possible that the appraisal method that is used for Odisha Revenue Board land is not accurate, in which case it would not be an outlier. I haven’t studied the appraisal methods used for different plots in different states and so I can’t comment on it right now. It may be a topic of discussion in a future post.\nBut for a moment I just want to put the 4,160 square kilometers of surplus land that Free A Billion has given sources for in context. This is roughly equal to 4500 crore square feet, or around 45 square per adult. If we take FSI to be 3, it translates to around 135 square feet of constructed area per adult. If the government leased all this surplus land, collected rent on it and distributed that rent equally amongst all adults, each adult will get a rent for around 135 square feet (or more or less depending on FSI).\nUPDATE (30 June 2023): I contacted one of the directors of Free A Billion Pvt. Ltd. to figure out how have they come up with the figure of Rs. 340 lakh crore but their response wasn’t satisfactory. Here’s the exchange of emails I had with them:\n\nI should have actually written mineral reserves of ~Rs. 5000e12 and not ~1001e12, because Rs. 1001e12 is supposed to be the resource rent paid to the government for that amount of reserves according to them but that’s not relevant for this post.\n\nI’ve redacted Kumar Anand’s email ID and phone number but not Rajesh’s (the director) email ID because it was openly available on the internet.\n\n\n\nI did not receive any response to my last email.\nThe dataset I mentioned in my first email is available here and the .csv file I attached to my last email is TOTAL_NATURAL_RESOURCE_RENTS.csv."

    "title": "Indian policy on drug patents: pre-1970, 1970 to 1999 and post-2004",
    "section": "",
    "text": "“Owning the sun” by Alexander Zaitchik seems to be a good book on the ills of drug patents. I’ve not read the entire book but I’ve read parts where it talks about India by searching for relevant keywords. I think it gets the Indian policy on drug patents and its effects right in broad strokes but gives a misleading impression on who conceded to make the 1970 Patents Act TRIPS-compliant and under whose government did the law get enacted in the first place.\n\nIndia held out a little longer, but by 1990 had also succumbed to US pressure. Under the terms of TRIPS, the country would have ten years from the date of signing to revise its 1970 Patents Act to fit a mold cast by Western drug giants. The Nehru-era patent act was more than an institution of national pride—it was the foundation for a generics industry known as the pharmacy to the poor, the source of affordable treatments for malaria, cancer, and tuberculosis across the global south. When the news reached India, street protests against the government of Rajiv Gandhi broke out across the country.\n\nWell, Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister till December 2, 1989, not 1990, so I’m guessing the author is referring to India’s agreement to the inclusion of substantive norms and standards for the protection and enforcement of IP in the TNC meeting of April 1989, which should be viewed in the context of India’s document tabled in July 1989 that noted its desire for flexibility/exceptions for the food and pharmaceutical sectors. This contention was carried in the text reached at the Brussels meeting. Refer Part IV Chapter 11 of WTO’s publication, “The Making of the TRIPS Agreement.”\nSome relevant excerpts:\n\nIndia also thought that, once the substantive norms and standards for protection of IPRs was brought into the mandate, efforts could be made to balance protection of IPRs with the developmental, technological and policy objectives of the host countries, to carve out exceptions for the special needs of developing countries, and to obtain sufficiently long transition periods for switching over to the new regime. There were indications, at least from some developed countries, that differential treatment for developing countries in this manner could be worked out during the course of negotiations. […] After the finalization of the negotiating mandate in the TNC meeting of April 1989, India tabled, for the first time, a comprehensive document setting out its views on norms and standards for protection of various types of IPRs.[6] It did not suggest their formulation in legal terms but was about the principles that must inform them, from a developing country’s perspective. With respect to patents, the document argued for freedom and flexibility for developing countries in the matter of grant of patent protection in sectors such as food and pharmaceuticals.\n\nReference [6] says that the document was tabled in July 1989, i.e. under the prime ministership of Rajiv Gandhi.\n\nit stated that, while patent protection will be available in all fields technology, a licence of right will also be automatically available to any person wanting to work the patent in the case of food and medicines; it is for each national legislature to determine the duration of patent protection it wants to grant; a patent owner has the obligation to work the patented invention in the territory of grant, failing which a compulsory licence is liable to be granted; a compulsory licence may also be granted, where necessary, in the public interest to secure free competition; and the agreement shall be implemented in the relevant international organization.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\nOn their part, the industrialized countries had already tabled their proposals in early 1990, taking equally strident positions that focused only on watertight protection and enforcement of IPRs. According to them, a compulsory licence could be granted only in narrowly defined circumstances and certainly not for the non- working of patents. The negotiations therefore lingered on in this phase without any tangible meeting ground until the text was reached at the Brussels ministerial meeting in December 1990. That text merely put in brackets the contentious proposals of each side on issues such as duration of patents, obligation to work patents, exclusion from patentability of food, chemical and pharmaceutical products, and forum of implementation of the agreement. With the breakdown of the Brussels ministerial meeting for other reasons, this phase of the negotiations went into limbo.\n\nSo, if any, future PMs and MPs, who agreed without any exceptions for pharma and legislated those changes, should be blamed. Read the following excerpt from this paper and decide for yourself which governments should be blamed:\n\nIndia became a member of the Paris convention and signed the Patent cooperation treaty with effect from December 7, 1998. Since then, amendments to the Patent Act were enacted in April 1999 and May 2002. The third amendment became due. The necessary bill to make the Indian Patents Act TRIPS-compliant was supposed to have been tabled during the 2004 winter session of Parliament; instead, an ordinance was passed on December 26, 2004, which came into effect on January 1, 2005. This ordinance modified the Indian Patents Act. This ordinance was itself modified and the Patents (Amendment) Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on March 22 and March 23, 2005, respectively. The President signed the bill on April 5, 2005, making it an Act of Parliament.\n\nApart from this, it calls the 1970 Patents Act, “The Nehru-era patent act” when Nehru was not even alive in 1970 and the actual patent law during Nehru’s government had both process and product patent. This changed in 1970 under, his daughter, Indira Gandhi’s government.\n\nBut the more important factor behind India’s opposition to TRIPS was the character of the Indian Patents Act 1970 and the Indian pharmaceuticals industry that it had spawned. Under British rule, India had the Patents and Designs Act 1911, which granted product and process patents in every sector and prohibited compulsory licences without the involvement of the patent holder. Local pharmaceutical production by Indian companies was therefore at a standstill and imported medicines held sway in the marketplace, albeit at unaffordable prices. This situation led to the formation of the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association in 1961 and it lobbied strongly for the enactment of a new patent law that would encourage local production of pharmaceuticals and thereby make them available to people at low prices. Following the recommendations of a committee appointed under the chairmanship of a High Court judge, a new law, namely, the Indian Patents Act 1970, was enacted, which repealed the 1911 Act insofar as it related to patents. The new Patents Act 1970 came into force on 20 April 1972.\nThe new law was truly a turning point for the domestic pharmaceuticals industry. Five features of the new law are worth noting here to show how far apart it was from the TRIPS Agreement. First, the Act provided for only process patents, and prohibited product patents, in the food, pharmaceutical and chemicals sectors. Second, the Act provided for a term of only seven years for process patents in the food and pharmaceuticals sectors, while for process patents in the chemicals sector, and for product or process patents in all other sectors, the term was 14 years from the date of filing. Third, compulsory licences could be granted liberally under the Act, including for non-working of the patents. Fourth, the Act allowed for automatic “licences of right” in the food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals sectors, under which anyone could produce and sell such products on payment of a royalty not exceeding 4 per cent. Fifth, in the case of process patents also, the owner of the patent had to prove the alleged infringement of his or her patent in a court of law. In a nutshell, the Indian Patents Act 1970 did not allow a patent worth its salt in the food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals sectors.\nThe Act was a shot in the arm for the domestic pharmaceuticals manufacturers. Thanks to the abundant skilled manpower available in India in chemical technology, especially in the synthesis of chemical molecules, the domestic pharmaceuticals industry started producing new patented chemical entities through reverse engineering, choosing pharmaceuticals that had proved their safety and efficacy in the industrialized world and that had also become commercial blockbusters there. In addition, governmental regulations that compelled the manufacture of medicines from the basic stage, prohibiting simply the transformation of intermediate products into bulk pharmaceuticals or formulations, as well as the setting up of public sector undertakings in the pharmaceuticals sector, also helped India acquire the necessary skills in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Within three to five years of new drugs being introduced into the world market, they were introduced in India at a fraction of their world prices. Although this did not lead to new drugs being discovered in India for diseases relevant to India (a point to which I will return), it is not an exaggeration to say that, if India today is a major supplier of generic drugs to the world market, the seeds of it were sown by the Indian Patents Act 1970.\n\nNevertheless, thwarting foreign drug patents to stimulate the domestic industry is one theme that transcends international borders.\n\nOne episode I learned about is how Woodrow Wilson broke German pharma patent thickets during World War I, which essentially created the modern American pharmaceutical industry. - Matt Stoller on Twitter"

    "title": "‘I guarantee you a 100% defeat’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this thread, Shantanu Gupta, who is the author of a biography of the sitting Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, expounded upon his theory that Indira Gandhi, who was the Prime Minister at the time of the liberation of Bangladesh, mishandled the situation and that it was the Jan Sangh, which later merged into the Janta Party and was eventually succeeded by the Bhartiya Janta Party, which somehow compelled Indira Gandhi to act on the situation. His theory falls apart as soon as you take some basic facts into account. First, I think you should read his thread so that you get the timeline, without the “missing piece” which he ignores that will make his theory fall apart, right and so that this article doesn’t make you misunderstand Gupta’s position.\nThe missing piece to Gupta’s theory that completely misrepresents the situation at that time is very well explained by none other than the Chief of Army Staff at the time of that war, Sam Manekshaw, in an interview he gave later where he revisited his meeting with Indira Gandhi and her Cabinet on, I guess the 23rd of April, or around that time based on what he said in the interview. You can watch it starting at 5:10 from here and here’s a transcript of the relevant part that I wrote:\n\nMrs. Gandhi, in an awful temper, looked at me read out messages from the Chief Minister of West Bengal that thousands of refugees are pouring. From the Chief Minister of Assam, Chief Minister of Tripura. And she looked at me said, “What are you doing about it?” I said, “Nothing, what’s it going to do with me?” She said, “I want you to do something.” I said, “What do you want me to do?” She said, “I want you to march into East Pakistan.” I said, “That means war!” She said, “I don’t mind if it’s war.” I said, “Oh have you read the Bible? God said let there be light and there was light and you say let there be war and there’s war? Are you ready? I certainly am not. And I said, this was about 23rd of April, I said, ”You know, the Himalayan passes are opening and if the Chinese give us an ultimatum.” and I said, ”The monsoon will be breaking in a few days time and when it rains in that part of the world, it pours — rivers become like oceans, if you stand on one bank you can’t see the other, my movement will be confined to roads, because of climatic conditions the Air Force will not be able to support me, and if I were to go in, I guarantee you a hundred percent defeat. I said to Mr. Gandhi, Will you know give me your orders?” She said,”Alright, Cabinet would meet again at 4 o’clock.” Everybody started walking out, I being the junior one, smile on my face as I was walking out. She said, “Chief, stay behind.” I said, “Prime Minister, before you open your mouth, shall I send in my resignation on grounds of health, mental or physical? She said,”Oh, sit down Sam and tell me — everything you told me is the truth?” I said, “Yes, everything I’ve told you is the truth. It’s my job to fight. Fight to win, not to lose.” She smiled at me and said, “Alright Sam, you let me know when you’re ready.”\n\n(emphasis mine)\nNow this was around the April of 1971, when the Chief of Army Staff tells the Prime Minister that he can’t win a war at that time because during the monsoon season, there’s heavy rainfall in the region where there’s East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), West Bengal, Assam. And in that heavy rainfall, the Army wouldn’t be able to travel off-roads, the Air Force wouldn’t be able to support them and that he guarantees her a 100% defeat. And Gupta, in his thread criticizes Indira Gandhi for not intervening in May and July! Essentially, when we would have been defeated due to climatic conditions according to that Chief of Army Staff at that time.\nOne can point out other flaws in Indira Gandhi’s handling of the situation and maybe pressure from opposition parties was actually a contributory factor in her decision to intervene but as far as not acting at the time of monsoon is concerned, there’s no case to be made against her."

    "title": "Evidence for the infant industry argument for protectionism",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Réka Juhász’s “Temporary Protection and Technology Adoption: Evidence from the Napoleonic Blockade”, which I found while reading Noah Smith’s Bloomberg piece “The Case for Protecting Infant Industries,” uses a natural expermiment during the Napoleonic Wars to estimate the causal effect of temporary trade protection. Here’s how Smith describes Juhász study and the general problem of endogeneity in cross-industry (or cross-country) regressions which many academicians use to reject the effectiveness of industrial policy:\n\n[I]n the middle of the 20th century, the doctrine [of infant industry protection] came under attack from economists. Studies of industrial policies in places like Turkey showed disappointing results. Productivity in the shielded industries didn’t even go up. Infant-industry protection was broadly rejected along with other economic heresies.\nThis dismissal was premature. Arguments from theory can break down in any number of ways. And examples like Turkey’s aren’t true random experiments – for example, countries might try to use protectionism to shore up industries that were uncompetitive to begin with, and which had little hope of ever flourishing. Policy decisions don’t just drive economic conditions, they’re also driven by them. To really know whether infant-industry protection is effective, we’d need some kind of random event that affected the competitive environment.\nEconomist Reka Juhasz, of Princeton and Columbia, combed through the historical record to find such a random event. And she found one: the Napoleonic Wars. It seems doubtful that Napoleon’s conquest of Europe was an elaborate scheme to protect failing French manufacturing industries, so it’s probably safe to consider its effects as akin to an act of God.\nDuring his wars with Britain, Napoleon tried (unsuccessfully) to bring his island nemesis to its knees by cutting it off from European markets. The move protected industries within the sprawling Napoleonic domains that competed heavily with Britain. The prime example was mechanized cotton spinning, a very high-tech industry for its time, and a locus of intense competition between early industrial nations like Britain and France. With detailed historical records, Juhasz was able to identify how much different regions saw their trade costs with Britain go up as the result of Napoleon’s embargo, and to see whether cotton spinners in those areas flourished. \nThey did. Juhasz found that in the short term, profits of protected cotton spinners rose, and their size and productivity increased more in the long run. Decades later, these regions were exporting more, relative to less-protected regions, showing that companies in the shielded areas were eventually able to compete in global markets – just as the infant-industry argument would predict.\nThis study, though clever and carefully executed, is just one example – if the infant-industry argument is going to become widely accepted, it will need a lot more evidence. But this paper suggests that it might be worth taking a second look at the idea.\n\nAll good except how he covered Hamilton’s proposals just before the above excerpt:\n\n[Hamilton] suggested subsidies – which he called “bounties” – as the best tool for helping young manufacturing industries, as opposed to tariffs. Casual observation would suggest that Hamilton’s strategy worked well, or at least didn’t hurt too much, as the U.S. became an industrial powerhouse.\n\nI think this is misleading given that the “bounties” that Hamilton proposed in his 1791 “Report on Manufacturers,” were not implemented, except the bounties for cod fisheries, while most of the tariffs that he recommended that year and/or the next year were implemented. I found this information from Douglas A. Irwin’s paper “The Aftermath of Hamilton’s “Report on Manufactures”, where he writes that\n\nAlthough Hamilton’s proposals for bounties (subsidies) failed to receive support, virtually every tariff recommendation put forward in the report was adopted by Congress in early 1792.\n\nIrwin also provides House voting records on bounties & tariffs and a table with certain 1791 tariff rates, Hamilton’s recommendations and 1792 tariff rates in the paper.\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nI brought this to Noah’s attention on Twitter and he ackowledged this while also writing that “Ha-Joon Chang covers this in his books,” introducing me to an economist whose work I might cover in future posts on industrial policy. Till then, I’ll leave you with a genuinely funny excerpt from his piece, “History debunks the free trade myth,” in the Guardian:\n\nYou are visiting a developing country as a policy analyst. It has the highest average tariff rate in the world. Most of the population cannot vote, and vote buying and electoral fraud are widespread.\nThe country has never recruited a single civil servant through an open process. Its public finances are precarious, with loan defaults that worry investors. It has no competition law, has abolished its shambolic bankruptcy law, and does not acknowledge foreigners’ copyrights. In short, it is doing everything against the advice of the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO and the international investment community.\nSounds like a recipe for development disaster? But no. The country is the US - only that the time is around 1880, when its income level was similar to that of Morocco and Indonesia today. Despite wrong policies and sub-standard institutions, it was then one of the fastest-growing - and rapidly becoming one of the richest - countries in the world.\n\nThe rest of his piece is also worth a read."
