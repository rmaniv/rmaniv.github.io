    "title": "Evidence for the infant industry argument for protectionism",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Réka Juhász’s “Temporary Protection and Technology Adoption: Evidence from the Napoleonic Blockade”, which I found while reading Noah Smith’s Bloomberg piece “The Case for Protecting Infant Industries,” uses a natural expermiment during the Napoleonic Wars to estimate the causal effect of temporary trade protection. Here’s how Smith describes Juhász study and the general problem of endogeneity in cross-industry (or cross-country) regressions which many academicians use to reject the effectiveness of industrial policy:\n\n[I]n the middle of the 20th century, the doctrine [of infant industry protection] came under attack from economists. Studies of industrial policies in places like Turkey showed disappointing results. Productivity in the shielded industries didn’t even go up. Infant-industry protection was broadly rejected along with other economic heresies.\nThis dismissal was premature. Arguments from theory can break down in any number of ways. And examples like Turkey’s aren’t true random experiments – for example, countries might try to use protectionism to shore up industries that were uncompetitive to begin with, and which had little hope of ever flourishing. Policy decisions don’t just drive economic conditions, they’re also driven by them. To really know whether infant-industry protection is effective, we’d need some kind of random event that affected the competitive environment.\nEconomist Reka Juhasz, of Princeton and Columbia, combed through the historical record to find such a random event. And she found one: the Napoleonic Wars. It seems doubtful that Napoleon’s conquest of Europe was an elaborate scheme to protect failing French manufacturing industries, so it’s probably safe to consider its effects as akin to an act of God.\nDuring his wars with Britain, Napoleon tried (unsuccessfully) to bring his island nemesis to its knees by cutting it off from European markets. The move protected industries within the sprawling Napoleonic domains that competed heavily with Britain. The prime example was mechanized cotton spinning, a very high-tech industry for its time, and a locus of intense competition between early industrial nations like Britain and France. With detailed historical records, Juhasz was able to identify how much different regions saw their trade costs with Britain go up as the result of Napoleon’s embargo, and to see whether cotton spinners in those areas flourished. \nThey did. Juhasz found that in the short term, profits of protected cotton spinners rose, and their size and productivity increased more in the long run. Decades later, these regions were exporting more, relative to less-protected regions, showing that companies in the shielded areas were eventually able to compete in global markets – just as the infant-industry argument would predict.\nThis study, though clever and carefully executed, is just one example – if the infant-industry argument is going to become widely accepted, it will need a lot more evidence. But this paper suggests that it might be worth taking a second look at the idea.\n\nAll good except how he covered Hamilton’s proposals just before the above excerpt:\n\n[Hamilton] suggested subsidies – which he called “bounties” – as the best tool for helping young manufacturing industries, as opposed to tariffs. Casual observation would suggest that Hamilton’s strategy worked well, or at least didn’t hurt too much, as the U.S. became an industrial powerhouse.\n\nI think this is misleading given that the “bounties” that Hamilton proposed in his 1791 “Report on Manufacturers,” were not implemented, except the bounties for cod fisheries, while most of the tariffs that he recommended that year and/or the next year were implemented. I found this information from Douglas A. Irwin’s paper “The Aftermath of Hamilton’s “Report on Manufactures”, where he writes that\n\nAlthough Hamilton’s proposals for bounties (subsidies) failed to receive support, virtually every tariff recommendation put forward in the report was adopted by Congress in early 1792.\n\nIrwin also provides House voting records on bounties & tariffs and a table with certain 1791 tariff rates, Hamilton’s recommendations and 1792 tariff rates in the paper.\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nI brought this to Noah’s attention on Twitter and he ackowledged this while also writing that “Ha-Joon Chang covers this in his books,” introducing me to an economist whose work I might cover in future posts on industrial policy. Till then, I’ll leave you with a genuinely funny excerpt from his piece, “History debunks the free trade myth,” in the Guardian:\n\nYou are visiting a developing country as a policy analyst. It has the highest average tariff rate in the world. Most of the population cannot vote, and vote buying and electoral fraud are widespread.\nThe country has never recruited a single civil servant through an open process. Its public finances are precarious, with loan defaults that worry investors. It has no competition law, has abolished its shambolic bankruptcy law, and does not acknowledge foreigners’ copyrights. In short, it is doing everything against the advice of the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO and the international investment community.\nSounds like a recipe for development disaster? But no. The country is the US - only that the time is around 1880, when its income level was similar to that of Morocco and Indonesia today. Despite wrong policies and sub-standard institutions, it was then one of the fastest-growing - and rapidly becoming one of the richest - countries in the world.\nEspecially in relation to trade policy. Many top economists, including Adam Smith, had been telling Americans for over a century that they should not protect their industries - exactly what today’s development orthodoxy tells developing countries.\nBut the Americans knew exactly what the game was. Many knew all too clearly that Britain, which was preaching free trade to their country, became rich on the basis of protectionism and subsidies. Ulysses Grant, the Civil war hero and US president between 1868 and 1876, remarked that “within 200 years, when America has gotten out of protection all that it can offer, it too will adopt free trade”. How prescient - except that his country did rather better than his prediction.\nThe fact is that rich countries did not develop on the basis of the policies and institutions they now recommend to developing countries. Virtually all of them used tariff protection and subsidies to develop their industries. In the earlier stages of their development, they did not even have basic institutions such as democracy, a central bank and a professional civil service.\nThere were exceptions, such as Switzerland and the Netherlands, which always maintained free trade. But even these do not conform to today’s development orthodoxy. Above all, they did not protect patents and so freely took technologies from abroad.\nOnce they became rich, these countries started demanding that the poorer countries practise free trade and introduce “advanced” institutions - if necessary through colonialism and unequal treaties. Friedrich List, the leading German economist of the mid-19th century, argued that in this way the more developed countries wanted to “kick away the ladder” with which they climbed to the top and so deny poorer countries the chance to develop.\nAfter the second world war, thanks to post-colonial guilt and cold war politics, developing countries were allowed substantial policy autonomy. For a few decades “ladder-kicking” was at low ebb.\nBut it has been resumed with renewed vigour in the last two decades, when developed countries have exerted enormous pressures on developing countries to adopt free trade, deregulate their economies, open their capital markets, and adopt “best-practice” institutions such as strong patent laws.\n\nThe rest of his piece is also worth a read."

    "title": "‘I guarantee you a 100% defeat’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this thread, Shantanu Gupta, who is the author of a biography of the sitting Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, expounded upon his theory that Indira Gandhi, who was the Prime Minister at the time of the liberation of Bangladesh, mishandled the situation and that it was the Jan Sangh, which later merged into the Janta Party and was eventually succeeded by the Bhartiya Janta Party, which somehow compelled Indira Gandhi to act on the situation. His theory falls apart as soon as you take some basic facts into account. First, I think you should read his thread so that you get the timeline, without the “missing piece” which he ignores that will make his theory fall apart, right and so that this article doesn’t make you misunderstand Gupta’s position.\nThe missing piece to Gupta’s theory that completely misrepresents the situation at that time is very well explained by none other than the Chief of Army Staff at the time of that war, Sam Manekshaw, in an interview he gave later where he revisited his meeting with Indira Gandhi and her Cabinet on, I guess the 23rd of April, or around that time based on what he said in the interview. You can watch it starting at 5:10 from here and here’s a transcript of the relevant part that I wrote:\n\nMrs. Gandhi, in an awful temper, looked at me read out messages from the Chief Minister of West Bengal that thousands of refugees are pouring. From the Chief Minister of Assam, Chief Minister of Tripura. And she looked at me said, “What are you doing about it?” I said, “Nothing, what’s it going to do with me?” She said, “I want you to do something.” I said, “What do you want me to do?” She said, “I want you to march into East Pakistan.” I said, “That means war!” She said, “I don’t mind if it’s war.” I said, “Oh have you read the Bible? God said let there be light and there was light and you say let there be war and there’s war? Are you ready? I certainly am not. And I said, this was about 23rd of April, I said, ”You know, the Himalayan passes are opening and if the Chinese give us an ultimatum.” and I said, ”The monsoon will be breaking in a few days time and when it rains in that part of the world, it pours — rivers become like oceans, if you stand on one bank you can’t see the other, my movement will be confined to roads, because of climatic conditions the Air Force will not be able to support me, and if I were to go in, I guarantee you a hundred percent defeat. I said to Mr. Gandhi, Will you know give me your orders?” She said,”Alright, Cabinet would meet again at 4 o’clock.” Everybody started walking out, I being the junior one, smile on my face as I was walking out. She said, “Chief, stay behind.” I said, “Prime Minister, before you open your mouth, shall I send in my resignation on grounds of health, mental or physical? She said,”Oh, sit down Sam and tell me — everything you told me is the truth?” I said, “Yes, everything I’ve told you is the truth. It’s my job to fight. Fight to win, not to lose.” She smiled at me and said, “Alright Sam, you let me know when you’re ready.”\n\n(emphasis mine)\nNow this was around the April of 1971, when the Chief of Army Staff tells the Prime Minister that he can’t win a war at that time because during the monsoon season, there’s heavy rainfall in the region where there’s East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), West Bengal, Assam. And in that heavy rainfall, the Army wouldn’t be able to travel off-roads, the Air Force wouldn’t be able to support them and that he guarantees her a 100% defeat. And Gupta, in his thread criticizes Indira Gandhi for not intervening in May and July! Essentially, when we would have been defeated due to climatic conditions according to that Chief of Army Staff at that time.\nOne can point out other flaws in Indira Gandhi’s handling of the situation and maybe pressure from opposition parties was actually a contributory factor in her decision to intervene but as far as not acting at the time of monsoon is concerned, there’s no case to be made against her."

    "title": "Indian policy on drug patents: pre-1970, 1970 to 1999 and post-2004",
    "section": "",
    "text": "“Owning the sun” by Alexander Zaitchik seems to be a good book on the ills of drug patents. I’ve not read the entire book but I’ve read parts where it talks about India by searching for relevant keywords. I think it gets the Indian policy on drug patents and its effects right in broad strokes but gives a misleading impression on who conceded to make the 1970 Patents Act TRIPS-compliant and under whose government did the law get enacted in the first place.\n\nIndia held out a little longer, but by 1990 had also succumbed to US pressure. Under the terms of TRIPS, the country would have ten years from the date of signing to revise its 1970 Patents Act to fit a mold cast by Western drug giants. The Nehru-era patent act was more than an institution of national pride—it was the foundation for a generics industry known as the pharmacy to the poor, the source of affordable treatments for malaria, cancer, and tuberculosis across the global south. When the news reached India, street protests against the government of Rajiv Gandhi broke out across the country.\n\nWell, Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister till December 2, 1989, not 1990, so I’m guessing the author is referring to India’s agreement to the inclusion of substantive norms and standards for the protection and enforcement of IP in the TNC meeting of April 1989, which should be viewed in the context of India’s document tabled in July 1989 that noted its desire for flexibility/exceptions for the food and pharmaceutical sectors. This contention was carried in the text reached at the Brussels meeting. Refer Part IV Chapter 11 of WTO’s publication, “The Making of the TRIPS Agreement.”\nSome relevant excerpts:\n\nIndia also thought that, once the substantive norms and standards for protection of IPRs was brought into the mandate, efforts could be made to balance protection of IPRs with the developmental, technological and policy objectives of the host countries, to carve out exceptions for the special needs of developing countries, and to obtain sufficiently long transition periods for switching over to the new regime. There were indications, at least from some developed countries, that differential treatment for developing countries in this manner could be worked out during the course of negotiations. […] After the finalization of the negotiating mandate in the TNC meeting of April 1989, India tabled, for the first time, a comprehensive document setting out its views on norms and standards for protection of various types of IPRs.[6] It did not suggest their formulation in legal terms but was about the principles that must inform them, from a developing country’s perspective. With respect to patents, the document argued for freedom and flexibility for developing countries in the matter of grant of patent protection in sectors such as food and pharmaceuticals.\n\nReference [6] says that the document was tabled in July 1989, i.e. under the prime ministership of Rajiv Gandhi.\n\nit stated that, while patent protection will be available in all fields technology, a licence of right will also be automatically available to any person wanting to work the patent in the case of food and medicines; it is for each national legislature to determine the duration of patent protection it wants to grant; a patent owner has the obligation to work the patented invention in the territory of grant, failing which a compulsory licence is liable to be granted; a compulsory licence may also be granted, where necessary, in the public interest to secure free competition; and the agreement shall be implemented in the relevant international organization.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\nOn their part, the industrialized countries had already tabled their proposals in early 1990, taking equally strident positions that focused only on watertight protection and enforcement of IPRs. According to them, a compulsory licence could be granted only in narrowly defined circumstances and certainly not for the non- working of patents. The negotiations therefore lingered on in this phase without any tangible meeting ground until the text was reached at the Brussels ministerial meeting in December 1990. That text merely put in brackets the contentious proposals of each side on issues such as duration of patents, obligation to work patents, exclusion from patentability of food, chemical and pharmaceutical products, and forum of implementation of the agreement. With the breakdown of the Brussels ministerial meeting for other reasons, this phase of the negotiations went into limbo.\n\nSo, if any, future PMs and MPs, who agreed without any exceptions for pharma and legislated those changes, should be blamed. Read the following excerpt from this paper and decide for yourself which governments should be blamed:\n\nIndia became a member of the Paris convention and signed the Patent cooperation treaty with effect from December 7, 1998. Since then, amendments to the Patent Act were enacted in April 1999 and May 2002. The third amendment became due. The necessary bill to make the Indian Patents Act TRIPS-compliant was supposed to have been tabled during the 2004 winter session of Parliament; instead, an ordinance was passed on December 26, 2004, which came into effect on January 1, 2005. This ordinance modified the Indian Patents Act. This ordinance was itself modified and the Patents (Amendment) Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on March 22 and March 23, 2005, respectively. The President signed the bill on April 5, 2005, making it an Act of Parliament.\n\nApart from this, it calls the 1970 Patents Act, “The Nehru-era patent act” when Nehru was not even alive in 1970 and the actual patent law during Nehru’s government had both process and product patent. This changed in 1970 under, his daughter, Indira Gandhi’s government.\n\nBut the more important factor behind India’s opposition to TRIPS was the character of the Indian Patents Act 1970 and the Indian pharmaceuticals industry that it had spawned. Under British rule, India had the Patents and Designs Act 1911, which granted product and process patents in every sector and prohibited compulsory licences without the involvement of the patent holder. Local pharmaceutical production by Indian companies was therefore at a standstill and imported medicines held sway in the marketplace, albeit at unaffordable prices. This situation led to the formation of the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association in 1961 and it lobbied strongly for the enactment of a new patent law that would encourage local production of pharmaceuticals and thereby make them available to people at low prices. Following the recommendations of a committee appointed under the chairmanship of a High Court judge, a new law, namely, the Indian Patents Act 1970, was enacted, which repealed the 1911 Act insofar as it related to patents. The new Patents Act 1970 came into force on 20 April 1972.\nThe new law was truly a turning point for the domestic pharmaceuticals industry. Five features of the new law are worth noting here to show how far apart it was from the TRIPS Agreement. First, the Act provided for only process patents, and prohibited product patents, in the food, pharmaceutical and chemicals sectors. Second, the Act provided for a term of only seven years for process patents in the food and pharmaceuticals sectors, while for process patents in the chemicals sector, and for product or process patents in all other sectors, the term was 14 years from the date of filing. Third, compulsory licences could be granted liberally under the Act, including for non-working of the patents. Fourth, the Act allowed for automatic “licences of right” in the food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals sectors, under which anyone could produce and sell such products on payment of a royalty not exceeding 4 per cent. Fifth, in the case of process patents also, the owner of the patent had to prove the alleged infringement of his or her patent in a court of law. In a nutshell, the Indian Patents Act 1970 did not allow a patent worth its salt in the food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals sectors.\nThe Act was a shot in the arm for the domestic pharmaceuticals manufacturers. Thanks to the abundant skilled manpower available in India in chemical technology, especially in the synthesis of chemical molecules, the domestic pharmaceuticals industry started producing new patented chemical entities through reverse engineering, choosing pharmaceuticals that had proved their safety and efficacy in the industrialized world and that had also become commercial blockbusters there. In addition, governmental regulations that compelled the manufacture of medicines from the basic stage, prohibiting simply the transformation of intermediate products into bulk pharmaceuticals or formulations, as well as the setting up of public sector undertakings in the pharmaceuticals sector, also helped India acquire the necessary skills in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Within three to five years of new drugs being introduced into the world market, they were introduced in India at a fraction of their world prices. Although this did not lead to new drugs being discovered in India for diseases relevant to India (a point to which I will return), it is not an exaggeration to say that, if India today is a major supplier of generic drugs to the world market, the seeds of it were sown by the Indian Patents Act 1970.\n\nNevertheless, thwarting foreign drug patents to stimulate the domestic industry is one theme that transcends international borders.\n\nOne episode I learned about is how Woodrow Wilson broke German pharma patent thickets during World War I, which essentially created the modern American pharmaceutical industry. - Matt Stoller on Twitter"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Almost all governments, including the Indian government, took a 180 degree turn from a non-precautionary approach in January 2020 to a precautionary one in March/April 2020. Somehow, it was xenophobic or unnecessary to restrict international travelers but fine to let the working class, small businesses and students from poor households rip under lockdowns.\nI’m going to engage with one argument that calls for such precautionary measures in this post. Even though that argument could be used to call for precaution in January 2020 too, and would have led to restrictions on international (and maybe some domestic travel in China) travel, it’s something that I have less issues (and might even support) with than a draconian lockdown like the one that was imposed in India. I’m still engaging with the argument because it can and is also used for those measures that I consider draconian.\nThis shows that at its peak, India imposed more stringent restrictions than even China! However China was more stringent for a longer time. It also shows that both India and China placed more stringent restrictions than the US or Sweden — and most other Western countries which are not included in the figure above.\nDisclaimer: I’m not formally trained in statistics. I’m not good at math. I’m just trying to understand what the debate is about. I might have made some errors. It’d be great if anyone of you could help me understand where I’m wrong."

    "text": "1 Fat tails imply existential risk\nThe ultra-precautionary approach is usually justified by the claim that epidemics are “extemely fat-tailed”. What that means is that extreme outcomes, which in this case are epidemics with high death counts, are much more frequent than say what you would observe if it was a normal distribution.\n\nFigure 1 (Source: Cirillo, P., Taleb, N.N. Tail risk of contagious diseases. Nat. Phys. 16, 606–613 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-0921-x)\nThis histogram shows the number of epidemics from a historical dataset of 72 epidemics from (y-axis) for each casualty toll (x-axis). It shows that there are many epidemics with high casualties and the function doesn’t die down easily to 0.\n\nFigure 2 (Source: Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Yaneer Bar-Yam, Pasquale Cirillo. On single point forecasts for fat-tailed variables. International Journal of Forecasting. Volume 38, Issue 2. 2022. Pages 413-422. ISSN 0169-2070. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2020.08.008.)\nBased on Figure 1, we can see that it is similar to the following Pareto distribution. The mean of such functions is so far away that you cannot observe it. This means that the risk from an epidemic is apparently infinite. Since Cirillo and Taleb (2020) use a dataset with more than 1000 fatalities, it shows that if you have an outbreak with more than 1000 fatalities, you should assume infinite risk and take measures accordingly. This is what Norman, Bar-Yam and Taleb write in their January 2020 paper to call for “a precautionary approach to current and potential pandemic outbreaks that must include constraining mobility patterns in the early stages of an outbreak”:\n\nThe general (non-naive) precautionary principle [3] delineates conditions where actions must be taken to reduce risk of ruin, and traditional cost-benefit analyses must not be used. These are ruin problems where, over time, exposure to tail events leads to a certain eventual extinction. While there is a very high probability for humanity surviving a single such event, over time, there is eventually zero probability of surviving repeated exposures to such events. While repeated risks can be taken by individuals with a limited life expectancy, ruin exposures must never be taken at the systemic and collective level. In technical terms, the precautionary principle applies when traditional statistical averages are invalid because risks are not ergodic."

    "text": "2 Issues with Cirillo and Taleb’s dataset\nCirillo and Taleb (2020) used 72 epidemics in the last 2,500 years with more than 1,000 fatalities to show that the distribution of fatalities is strongly fat-tailed. Apparently this dataset comes from a Wikipedia article and a couple of online encyclopedias. When confronted that their study, being based on 72 most-noticed epidemics, would suffer from selection bias by Ioannidis et al (2020) because epidemics with higher fatalities would have a higher probability of being noticed and recorded in historical records, Taleb et al (2020) defend by saying that Cirillo and Taleb’s “dataset likely contains most (if not all) of them.” This, of course, doesn’t look like a reasonable justification. Here is an excerpt from Ioannidis et al that’ll further make their contention with Cirillo and Taleb clear:\n\nFor example, according to their dataset, the first epidemic originating from sub-Saharan Africa did not occur until 1920 AD, namely HIV/AIDS. The most famous outbreaks in human history are preferentially selected from the extreme tail of the distribution of all outbreaks. Tens of millions of outbreaks with a couple deaths must have happened throughout time. Probably hundreds of thousands might have claimed dozens of fatalities. Thousands of outbreaks might have exceeded 1,000 fatalities. Most eluded the historical record. The four garden variety coronaviruses may be causing such outbreaks every year.20,21 One of them, OC43 seems to have been introduced in humans as recently as 1890, probably causing a “bad influenza year” with over a million deaths.22 Based on what we know now, SARS-CoV-2 may be closer to OC43 than SARS-CoV-1. This does not mean it is not serious: its initial human introduction can be highly lethal, unless we protect those at risk.\n\nHere’s an answer from History Stackexchange that’ll further support Ioannidis et al’s point:\n\n[…]\nInstinctively, I have some doubts. Cirillo’s list is (as noted in comments) heavily sourced from Wikipedia’s list of epidemics; I make it 55/72 (56 with one dual-cited). Ten more are cited to a page on “ListFist”, which itself seems to be citing back to the same Wikipedia list. and then there are a couple of sources used once or twice. The WP list as of March 2020 is interesting - comparing it to the one in the article, it looks like they have mostly just skipped ones with no quoted death toll. For example, in the “15th century and earlier” section, WP includes an unknown death rate plague in 412 BC, and in 746 AD, neither of which are shown here (though they do include the 664 British plague, which WP had a blank death toll for).\nSo, some immediate problems appear. Firstly, the Wikipedia article does not claim to be comprehensive (later versions do misleadingly say “a list of the largest”, but this is not in the 2020 version), but they seem to have assumed it was.\nSecondly, it is trivial to follow the sources in Wikipedia and find a death toll well in excess of 1000 for some of those “blank” ones. For example, the cited source for the 1636 English plague gives a reasonably precise figure of 10,400 in its introductory paragraph, and mentions other outbreaks in 1603 and 1625 - 1603 but not 1625 is mentioned in Wikipedia, neither in Cirillo. It turns out 1625 killed 26,350 people per a footnote in that article; 1603 “over thirty thousand”. We’ve just extended the list by 4%, just with one country in a 33-year period.\nThirdly, just looking at Cirillo’s list, the distribution is striking. Up to the mid-sixth-century AD, they are all in the Mediterranean world; 562, 627, 688 are in Mesopotamia; 664 in Britain; 735 is the first in Asia proper. Then nothing until the Black Death in the fourteenth century. It seems vanishingly unlikely that, to pick some of the obvious points:\n\n\nChina or India - which had a population in the tens of millions - did not have any substantial epidemic outbreaks for most of its history;\n\n\nThere was only one major epidemic outbreak pre-1 AD;\n\n\nThere were none in the early Mesopotamian civilisations or in ancient Egypt;\n\n\nThere were none in Europe or the Mediterranean for most of the medieval period;\n\n\nOn that first point, in a comment above I mentioned McNeil’s Plagues and Peoples (1976). It has an appendix of epidemics recorded in Chinese sources; at a guess, there are around 200. These include what appear to be very major epidemics (killing a substantial proportion of the population in some provinces) in 312, 322, 413, 468, 682, 707, 762, 806… and those are just the ones with relative death tolls noted. It would be challenging to calculate numbers for an analysis like this one, granted, but it seems hard to just dismiss them from consideration because no estimate is available.\n\nUpdate: skimming the papers citing the original Cirillo paper, we find Intensity and frequency of extreme novel epidemics (PNAS, 2021), which offers a dataset that they have compiled.\n“In summary, the 1600 to 1945 dataset includes 182 epidemics with known occurrence, duration, and number of deaths, 108 known to have caused less than 10,000 deaths, and 105 for which only occurrence and duration are recorded, for a total of 395 epidemics.”\nSo that gives us almost 200 identified in a 350 year period with over 10,000 deaths, plus an indeterminate number of deaths unknown - well in excess of the original figure\n\n(I have replaced block quotes of the original text with double quotation marks and made some minor changes in formatting.)\nI think this makes it extremely clear that Cirillo and Taleb massively undercounted epidemics that passed their own threshold and the statement of Taleb et al (2020) that “dataset likely contains most (if not all) of them” is false since I could find more epidemics that were not included in their dataset than were, which means that the dataset doesn’t contain most, let alone all, of them.\nIn addition, I found Corral (2021) that discusses the incompleteness of the dataset used by Cirillo and Taleb extensively:\n\nII. DATA AND COMPLETENESS\nMost of the events analyzed in Ref. [6] come from the Wikipedia list of the largest known epidemics caused by in- fectious diseases [16]. The list was complemented with a few more events, obtained from other sources (mainly Ref. [17]). Restricting to epidemics causing 1000 or more fatalities, this led to N = 72 events, from 429 BC to 2020 AD (CE); the resulting data are provided in Table 1 of Ref. [6], in concrete, in the fourth numeric column (average estimate). We will refer to these data as the original data set.\nWe are not aware of any study of completeness of such data. In order to address this important point, we display the number of fatalities versus time of occurrence (beginning of the outbreak) in Fig. 1(a), where it can be clearly seen that the data look certainly inhomogeneous. For example, between 735 AD (Japanese smallpox epidemic) and 1485 AD there is only one event, which happens to be the Black Death (largest event on record, with roughly 140 000 000 fatalities, starting in 1331).\nFigure 1(b) confirms that the rate of occurrence of large epidemics seems to be highly inhomogeneous, from roughly three per century between 500 and 750 AD to just one in seven centuries (up to 1485) and to about 0.5 per year after 2000 AD. We associate this high variability mainly to the large incompleteness of the data and not to a wild variation of the occurrence of epidemics over the centuries.\nIncompleteness can also be seen in the uneven distribution of the smallest events considered, i.e., out of the 17 epidemics below 10 000 fatalities, only two are contained in the first half of the data (from 429 BC to 1813). Including events be- low the completeness threshold can lead to important biases.\nAlthough in Ref. [6] it is claimed that a Jackknife resampling technique can account for incompleteness, it is obvious that resampling does not correct any bias present in the data (one must not get confused by the fact that Jackknife corrects the bias of an estimator, which is clearly different from the bias arising from data incompleteness).\nFor this reason, in order to evaluate the impact of data incompleteness, in addition to analyze the raw data used in Ref. [6], we also consider a restricted data set, from 1485 to 2000 AD, which shows a higher homogeneity, with an average of 0.1 epidemics per year. This restricted data set consists of N = 50 epidemics. Note that the largest event, the Black Death, is not contained in this data set; thus, this provides a way to test the robustness of the results in front of the value of the most extreme event. This also eliminates ongoing epidemics (such as the COVID-19) from the analysis (except the HIV/AIDS pandemic).\nA third data set, considered in Ref. [6], consists of rescaling the number of fatalities (of the original data set) by the entire world population at the time of the epidemic. This represents a procedure to take into account that the world population is far from stationary across history, and it is not the same to have 140 million of fatalities nowadays than in the Middle Ages (when the global population was around 400 million).\nHowever, it is questionable why one should rescale by the world population and not by the local population (i.e., the population of Greece for the plague of Athens), and also why the scaling is linear with the total world population (for instance, in a simple branching process the size does not scale linearly with the size of the underlying tree, but with the square of the number of generations [18], and in general one has to take into account the so-called fractal dimension of the avalanches; see, e.g., Ref. [19]). Nevertheless, we will also explore this simple rescaled data set in order to test the robustness of the results.\n\nCorral (2021) shows that the distribution of epidemic fatalities is equally well described by the Log-normal distribution as the Pareto distribution. The Log-normal distribution, as shown in Figure 3, has a milder tail than the Pareto distribution, so finding the mean is possible. 85% of observations fall below the mean. Half the observations fall below 13% of the mean. If this is true, it shows that (unlike what Cirillo & Taleb (2020) suggest) the risk is not apparently infinite and something that public health can prepare for with greater certainty than if what Cirillo and Taleb concluded was true.\n\nFigure 3 (Source: Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Yaneer Bar-Yam, Pasquale Cirillo. On single point forecasts for fat-tailed variables. International Journal of Forecasting. Volume 38, Issue 2. 2022. Pages 413-422. ISSN 0169-2070. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2020.08.008.)\nI’ve only touched the issues with the reliability of the dataset used to promote the idea that epidemics are fat-tailed but there are several other interesting issues around this debate which I may discuss in future posts."

    "text": "In a previous post, I tried to make sense of an estimate of the surplus land owned by the Indian government. The research I did for that post introduced me to the reality that there are several thousand acres of government-owned land parcels in my hometown, Delhi, that are either vacant or under-utilized or on an extremely cheap leasehold. These can be rented and the rent proceeds could be provided directly to the either the people of Delhi or the whole of India. I won’t get into whether we should be collecting rent from these selected land parcels or who should get the rent proceeds as of now, I might tackle those questions in a separate post later. In this post, I’m going to provide a high confidence lower bound figure for what the rent proceeds could be from land parcels in the city of Delhi.\nI found 4 main entities which own large swaths of land that was vacant or under-utilized or was on an extremely cheap leasehold in Delhi (~5.7% of the entire land area of Delhi) which could be potentially leased:\nThere was also a fifth entity, namely the Gram Sabha, but since a significant chunk of Gram Sabha land has been given to DDA, I decided to leave it for this post considering the uncertainity of whether I would have already included that in my estimation for the vacant parcels under DDA."

    "section": "1 Vacant land parcels under Delhi Development Authority (DDA)",
    "text": "1 Vacant land parcels under Delhi Development Authority (DDA)\n\nThe Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was established in the year 1957 under the provision of the Delhi Development Act,1957 to foster the development of New Delhi. DDA is controlled by the Union Ministry of Urban Development.\nDDA handles housing, infrastructure, commercial properties, land development, and sports complexes of the city. It acquires vast tracts of land for commercial, industrial, residential, and recreational purposes.\nA survey was conducted in 2014 with the help of National Productivity Council and Geospatial Data Limited regarding DDA administered land in the city. It revealed that around 5,500 acres of land under DDA was lying vacant across the city.[1] This comes to around 85 per cent of the area of Lutyens Bungalow Zone and around 50 per cent of the total land area of New Delhi.\nThe focus of the survey was to protect these plots from illegal encroachment. The survey also found that 298 acres of land under DDA was under litigation. However, there can be a possibility that DDA holds more such land parcels in the city which are kept unused and are locked by the organization.\nThese unused land parcels create an artificial scarcity of land in the city which imposes a cost on everyone. It results in an increase in the cost of land due to which the cost of infrastructure projects also increases. Freeing up all such unused and locked land parcels have the potential of reducing the artificial scarcity of land in the city.\nDetails of Vacant Land Under DDA\n\n\nThe total value of vacant land held under the DDA is about ₹ 11,481 crore. This value is computed using a conservative price of ₹ 4,71,600 with a meagre FSI of just 1. Refer to the map and accompanying table for details.\nExperts have estimated the value of these unused land parcels to be around ₹ 1 lakh crore.[3]. If these large chunks of unused land are monetized then each Indian household may set to gain atleast ₹ 459.\n1.0.1 References\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/DDA-reports-5484-acres-of-vacant-land/articleshow/45052865.cms\nDelhi Development Authority, [“DDA”]\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/DDA-sitting-on-Delhi-land-worth-Rs-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/45172286.cms\n\n\nsource\nFirst of all, the numbers in the wiki’s table and the rest of their text don’t addup. For example, they say they have used a rate of “Rs. 4,71,600” but don’t mention for how much land. If we go by their source [3], we can read that DDA’s then vice-chairman said:\n\nThis is for the first time in DDA’s history that the whole inventory of land, whose worth we estimate to be more than Rs 1 lakh crore, has been compiled and put in the public domain. […]\n\nThis is more than 9 times of what they estimate.\nIf we use DDA’s estimate for the value of the land (which I think they might have estimated using the circle rate), then the rate comes out close to Rs. 43,500 per square meter. This means that these parcels are located mainly in the localities in the circle-rate categories F, G and H. (It is common knowledge that the circle rate highly underestimates the sale price of land and if the land is auctioned, I won’t be surprised if they go for Rs. 1-2 lakh per square meter given larger parcels are divided into smaller ones so as to lower the entry barrier in the auction.)\nSecondly, since then, I think the DDA has updated their list of vacant land parcels that it owns, which you can download from here (click). I say this because my estimate using their list is different (more) than what the wiki says. I have calculated the total number of parcels and their total area by land use in Sheet1 of this spreadsheet. I couldn’t get accurate numbers due to errors in formatting and incomplete information provided in DDA’s list, for example, some parcels had unknown land-use, some has their area in unknown units, etc. But these numbers can, at least, be considered lower bounds.\nDDA owns a total of 4,255 vacant parcels, whose total area is at least 8,683 acres. This is equivalent of ~35 square kilometers or ~2.4% of the total land area of Delhi. These parcels are categorized for different land use roughly in the following manner:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand-use\nNo. of plots\nArea (in acres)\nArea (in sq m)\nArea (in sq ft)\n\n\n\n\nResidential\n1534\n2904\n11752942.32\n126498240\n\n\nCommercial\n333\n1810\n7326796.22\n78843600\n\n\nIndustrial\n405\n591\n2391761.62\n25743960\n\n\nNot known\n208\n273\n1105359.607\n11891880\n\n\nPSP\n245\n588\n2378708.544\n25613280\n\n\nResidential + Commercial + Industrial + Not known + PSP\n2725\n6166\n24955568.31\n268590960\n\n\n[Blank]\n503\n265\n1072132\n11543400\n\n\nCommunity Facilities\n6\n22\n88300\n958320\n\n\nTransport\n31\n59\n236823.63\n2570040\n\n\nUtility\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreational\n36\n515\n2085443\n22433400\n\n\nMutli-level parking\n1\n2\n8040\n87120\n\n\nGreen\n633\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal identified\n3308\n7029\n28446306.94\n306183240\n\n\nOthers\n917\n1654\n6692924.232\n72048240\n\n\nTotal\n4225\n8683\n35139231.18\n378231480\n\n\n\nTable: All of the land in the ‘Others’ category belongs to some Land-use category but had to be kept in a different bin due to formatting errors in DDA’s list.\nIt is also important to note that DDA is ready to re-define land use based on current needs as their then vice-chairman has clarified:\n\nAlso we are looking to redefine land uses. The land use was earmarked a long time ago. Based on current needs, we may change industrial land to residential.\n\nResidential, commercial, industrial, “not known” and PSP (i.e. Public and Semi-public facilities), sums up to ~2.5 crore square meters.\nIf we consider the circle rate of Rs. 43,500 per square meter and a rent rate (cap rate) of 2%, the rent proceeds from all this land will be ~Rs. 2,175 crore per year. (This checks with the valuation of the vice-chairmain since 2% of Rs. 1 lakh crore is Rs. 2,000 crore.) If this rent is distributed amongst all adult citizens (for the purpose of this post, I’m defining adult citizens as registered voters) of India, then each will receive ~Rs. 22 per year; if it is distributed amongst all adult citizens of Delhi, then each will receive ~Rs. 1,500 per year.\nFor context, if we consider FSI of 3 for residential buildings, then DDA is sitting on vacant land that can provide a built-up area of ~38 crore square feet. This is equivalent of ~3.8 lakh, 1,000 square feet flats. This is more than 10 times the annual housing unit sales of the entire Delhi NCR (not just Delhi). This means that it is possible that the real estate market will crash if all of this land is leased and so the rent collected might be less. Later, once this artificial land scarcity is reduced, productivity might increase and land prices might increase. Irrespective of whether land prices are higher or lower than what they are at now, people will be better off either via the rental income they will get or via lower land prices."

    "text": "2 Under-utilized Lutyens Bungalow Zone\n\nThe Lutyens Bungalow Zone (LBZ) is the most valuable parcel of real estate in the country. Located in the heart of Delhi it comprises of 3,000 government properties and 600 private bungalows.\nThe land parcel is actively kept out of reach of private individuals and heavily regulated. The population density of LBZ is just 14-15 people per acre while other parts of Delhi are starved for space with density as high as 1,100 to 1,600 people per acre. [1]\nLand allotment and its utilisation is highly arbitrary and discretionary on the government officials. There is an absence of a uniform rental policy in place for political groups that occupy the majority of the 25 sq. km area.\nIn their replies to RTI petitions, urban authorities have compounded the riddle that how sprawling Lutyens’ estates under government control are allocated.\nAn RTI filed with the authorities found out that the rules of the urban development ministry have been generously relaxed for the Congress and the BJP, India’s two big parties. In 2015, the Congress was served a government notice to vacate all four addresses. In fact, their allotment was also cancelled. Yet, the party remains in possession of all the estates. On paper, every national party is entitled to run an office on government land in Delhi for three years. After that, they are required to shift their work-place to privately-owned space.\nNational presidents of designated national political parties qualify for residential accommodation in Delhi only if they don’t have any other in any other capacity. The BJP has two bungalows in its possession in Lutyens’ Delhi: 11, Ashoka Road, its former party headquarter and 14, Pt. Pant Marg, office of the party’s state unit. Two different RTI responses by the directorate of estates give two different rentals for 11 Ashok Road. The March reply quotes it at Rs 3,920 per month, the April note to as high as Rs 78,921 a month.\nIn another response from the government, the Congress is paying merely Rs 3,920 as monthly rent for 24, Akbar Road. While the Chanakyapuri bungalow under the occupancy of NCP is used as the residence of party office-bearers.\nAs per a government circular of July 31, 2014 no state party is entitled to office space on government estate. However, the NCP, BSP, Samajwadi Party also have their offices in government-provided accommodation. [2]\nAccording to an official at DDA “At the core of the LBZ, there are many ‘loose’ areas, including triangular blocks, barracks, and quarters where proper utilisation of land and densification is possible.\nThe valuation of the 25 sq. km parcel is valued conservatively (u[s]ing FSI of only 1) at ₹ 19.32 lakh crore. [3]\n\nReferences\n\n“HT”\n“India Today”\n[Calculation - Total Area x Circle Rate] - 2,49,70,075.05 sq.metre (6,170.24 acre) x ₹ 7.74 lakh/sq.metre = ₹ 19.32 lak crore.\n\n\nsource (emphasis mine)\nIf we lease all this land and collect rent on it, then using their valuation of Rs. 19.32 lakh crore (which is based on the assumption of FSI of 1 and circle rate of Rs. 7.74 lakh per square meter) and a rent rate of 2%, the rent proceeds from all this land will be ~Rs. 38,640 crore per year. If this rent is distributed amongst all adult citizens of India, then each will receive ~Rs. 386 per year; if it is distributed amongst all adult citizens of Delhi, then each will receive ~Rs. 26,648 per year."

The actual area is ~4800 acres (i.e. ~244 acres less than the area within the perimeter I drew).\n\nThe Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has unearthed a whopping Rs 1.63 lakh crore scam related to the Delhi airport land deal.\nAccording to the CAG report, the government gave 4,799.09 acre of prime land on lease to its private sector partner Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) for development of the airport. The land was given on a paltry lease rent of Rs 100 per acre per year for a period of 60 years.\nInterestingly, DIAL itself has estimated that commercial exploitation of the land for 60 years would give it profit to the tune of Rs 1.63 lakh crore.\nIn its report, the CAG has indicted the Union civil aviation ministry’s role in land allocation in a number of places. It clearly states that “the ministry and the AAI (Airports Authority of India) have always ruled in favour of the operators and against the interest of the government”.\nThe loot did not stop at highly discounted lease rent. Despite that unfair advantage, DIAL went a step further and got a post-contractual benefit of levying airport development fees of Rs 1,300 extra for international flight and Rs 200 for domestic journey from each passenger.\nDIAL also mints money from the 5 per cent land it has been allowed to use for commercial exploitation. Hotels, malls etc have been built on this land and DIAL gets a share of their profits.\nMinister calls it ‘draft report’\nCivil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh played it safe on the damning CAG report. He said it was just a “draft report”.\n“It is a draft report. We will cooperate. Let us not level any allegations. We should wait for the final report,” the minister said.\n\nsource (emphasis mine)\nI have not been alble to find any reporting of a follow-up after this CAG report. I guess if the lease was shorter (like 5-10 years) and the rent was as per market rate, it would have been able to generate much more rent but even if we take the figure provided by CAG (i.e. Rs. 1.63 lakh crore for 60 years), the rent proceeds from this land parcel will be ~Rs. 2,716 crore per year. If this rent is distributed amongst all adult citizens of India, then each will receive ~Rs. 27 per year; if it is distributed amongst all adult citizens of Delhi, then each will receive ~1,874 per year."

    "text": "2 Sortition used by Tribals in Jharkhand\nThe findings of social anthropologist Alpa Shah reveal how tribals select their community leaders. (h/t Rahul Basu) I’m attaching an excerpt from one of her articles in the Hindustan Times, which describes how sortition was practiced and the roles of the leaders selected by it.\n\nI first saw it in December 2000, less than a month after Jharkhand became a separate state, in the Munda tribe village, where I was staying as a social anthropologist. They were selecting their new pahan and paenbharra, who presided over secular and sacred village matters, for three years.\nA man with a “light shadow” was blindfolded. He carried a winnowing basket on the edge of a pole, and was possessed by the village spirit, Sarna-mai. Shaking while he walked, as if he was being led by the spirit, he wandered from house to house, before eventually settling at one. He stopped shaking, an indication that Sarna-mai has chosen that house as the next pahan. The process was repeated for the paenbharra.\nA few years later, I stumbled across another selection in the neighbouring village. There, instead of wandering across the village, a man with a “light shadow” stood blindfolded in the middle of a large circle of stones. Each stone represented a household. Once possessed, the man went around round the circle until Sarna-mai settled at one of the stones: It was the house that will send the next pahan or paenbharra. A random choice, these villages seemed to be practising a form of ancient Athenian democracy — with a tribal twist.\nI tried tracing the local history of the pahans and paenbharras. Although many complained that the process has become corrupt in some villages, and that women did not seem to serve the roles, I could find no other pattern to who was chosen in these two villages. Instead, I found instances of selected households passing on the responsibility to others if they felt they could not fulfil it.\nThe roles did carry real responsibilities. Apart from propitiating the deities to ensure the village’s safety from droughts, disease and other calamities, the pahan and paenbharra coordinated the villagers to settle their disputes. They had to feed the entire village at least three times a year, and always maintain extra supplies as a social security net for the poor. For that purpose, they were assigned special lands and seven helpers to cultivate it for the duration of their role. In the colonial land settlement records, I found that the Adivasi rebellions had forced the British to recognise the values of these local democratic traditions. Across the 114 villages of that block I stayed in, their records show the method of selecting the local leaders and the lands reserved for the roles.\n\n(emphasis mine)"

    "text": "2 Some more real-world consequences of over-specialization\nIn “Why Didn’t We Test Our Trade’s ‘Antifragility’ Before COVID-19?”, Joe Norman and Gene Callahan add:\n\n[…] [C]ollapses due to over-specialization, prompted by international agencies [World Bank and IMF?] advising developing economies based on naive comparative-advantage analysis, have happened all too often. For instance, a number of African economies, persuaded to base their entire economy on a single good in which they had a comparative advantage (e.g, gold, cocoa, oil, or bauxite), saw their economies crash when the price of that commodity fell. People who had formerly been largely self-sufficient found themselves wage laborers for multinationals in good times, and dependents on foreign charity during bad times.\nWhile the case for extreme specialization in production collapses merely by letting prices vary, it gets even worse for the “just specialize in the single thing you do best” folks once we add in considerations of pandemics, wars, extreme climate change, and other such shocks. We have just witnessed how relying on China for such a high percentage of our medical supplies and manufacturing has proven unwise when faced with an epidemic originating in China.\nOn a smaller scale, the great urban theorist Jane Jacobs stressed the need for economic diversity in a city if it is to flourish. Detroit’s over-reliance on the automobile industry, and its subsequent collapse when that industry largely deserted it, is a prominent example of Jacobs’ point. And while Detroit is perhaps the most famous example of a city collapsing due to over-specialization,it is far from the only one."

    "text": "3 Solution - be exposed to random shocks\nNorman and Callahan talk about a solution to this problem inspired by “chaos engineering” tools which are often used in the tech industry. They describe the concept using Netflix’s Chaos Monkey as an example:\n\nOn April 21, 2011, the region of Amazon Web Services covering eastern North America crashed. The crash brought down the sites of large customers such as Quora, Foursquare, and Reddit. It took Amazon over a week to bring its system fully back online, and some customer data was lost permanently.\nBut one company whose site did not crash was Netflix. It turns out that Netflix had made themselves “antifragile” by employing software they called “Chaos Monkey,” which regularly and randomly brought down Netflix servers. By continually crashing their own servers, Netflix learned how to nevertheless keep other portions of their network running. And so when Amazon US-East crashed, Netflix ran on, unfazed.\n\nNorman and Callahan address the concern that the act of countries subjecting flow of goods to random shocks, or for that matter any type of shock in terms of banning trade, in the present state of affairs presents an institutional barrier.\n\nIf Freedonia suddenly bans the import of goods from Ruritania, even for a week, Ruritania is likely to regard this as a “trade war,” and may very well go to the WTO and seek relief. However, the point of this reorientation of trade policy is not to promote hostility to other countries, but to make one’s own country more resilient.\n\nBut they offer a solution that will allow countries to implement their solution without violating any WTO obligations or retaliation by other countries:\n\nA possible solution to this problem is that a national government could periodically, at random times, buy all of the imports of some good from some other country, and stockpile them. Then the foreign supplier would have no cause for complaint: its goods are still being purchased! But domestic manufacturers would have to learn to adjust to a disappearance of the supply of palm oil from Indonesia, or tin from China, or oil from Norway.\n\nI guess a country can devise a procedure similar to the following to avoid rent-seeking as much as possible:\n\nPre-decide the frequency and extent of these shocks, while keeping them as “good agnostic” as possible (without leading to something to the tune of self-inflicted extinction).\nGenerate a random seed, using a publicly verifiable process, that can be fed into RNGs to select the number of goods and countries to be subject to the supply shock, the exact goods and countries to be selected and the extent of the government buyout per good or country."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A lot of people think that judges are kind of powerless in certain stages of the criminal justice procedure and even if the judge is competent and non-corrupt, they can’t do much because the police and prosecutors have to be competent and non-corrupt as well — what if the police refuses to register an FIR? what if the police does not conduct the investigation properly? what if the prosecutor doesn’t present a crucial witness? etc. While I have no issues in attempting to solve the problems in our police and prosecution, I think Indian judges have vast powers and are almost like part-time police officers and prosecutors. They can direct police to register an FIR. They can monitor and supervise police investigation. They can take up cases suo-moto (by themselves). They consult DMs while they are deciding who can be a prosecutor. They can allow the victim to have private prosecution. They can summon any person as a witness and examine any person in court if they don’t like the way the prosecutor is examining them. Essentially, judges are not bottlenecked by the competence and corruption of the police and prosecutors.\nI’m listing the relevant powers based on the limited information I have about our criminal justice system. If you’re aware of any that are not listed below, it’d great if you could let me know or if anything, that I included, does not apply. (Some powers might be limited to certain judges only.)\n\n0.0.1 1. Registering FIR\nIf the police is not registering FIR or not starting the investigation, the Magistrate can order them to do so. One can directly go to the Magistrate with a complaint of a cognizable offense and the Magistrate can direct the police to register an FIR and investigate the matter.\n\nSection 156. Police officer’s power to investigate cognizable case.\n\nAny officer in charge of a police station may, without the order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII.\nNo proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in question on the ground that the case was one which such officer was not empowered under this section to investigate.\nAny Magistrate empowered under section 190 may order such an investigation as above- mentioned.\n\n\nSection 156 of CrPC\n\n\n0.0.2 2. Monitoring and supervising police investigation\nHC and SC judges can monitor and supervise police investigation. The Hindu reports on an SC judgement:\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that higher courts can monitor the progress of investigation in criminal cases if it is found that influential persons are trying to impact the course of justice.\nA Bench of Justices Altamas Kabir and Cyriac Joseph rejected the argument of some accused persons in a criminal case that courts have no power to monitor investigations as it amounted to usurping the role of the investigating agencies.\n\n\n\n0.0.3 3. Suo-moto case\nSC judges can start a case without complainer filing the complaint. See this and this. Here’s an excerpt from the first link:\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has often taken up cases ‘suo moto’. This means they take up cases by their own notice, without any petition being filed, or interest being brought before them.\nWhile such a power is granted by s. 23 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 for contempt of court, the use of the procedure in writ or judicial review jurisdiction has been novel. It developed from the relaxation of procedure when considering PILs. The first instance is often considered to be in the Sunil Batra case. The procedure for suo moto petitions was formalised only in 2014 by the adoption of Order 38, Rule 12(1)(a) in the Supreme Court Rules, 2013.\n\n\n\n0.0.4 4. Preparing list of prosecutors\nDM prepares list of prosecutors after consultation with Sessions Judge.\n\nSection 24. Public Prosecutors.\n\nThe District Magistrate shall, in consultation with the Sessions Judge, prepare a panel of names of persons, who are, in his opinion fit to be appointed as Public Prosecutors or Additional Public Prosecutors for the district.\nNo person shall be appointed by the State Government as the Public Prosecutor or Additional Public Prosecutor for the district unless his name appears in the panel of names prepared by the District Magistrate under sub-section (4).\n\n\nSection 24 of CrPC\n\n\n0.0.5 5. Private prosecution\nMagistrate can allow victim to have private prosecution if public prosecutors are misfit.\n\nSection 302. Permission to conduct prosecution.\n\nAny Magistrate inquiring into or trying a case may permit the prosecution to be conducted by any person other than a police officer below the rank of Inspector; but no person, other than the Advocate General or Government Advocate or a Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor, shall be entitled to do so without such permission: Provided that no police officer shall be permitted to conduct the prosecution if he has taken part in the investigation into the offence with respect to which the accused is being prosecuted.\nAny person conducting the prosecution may do so personally or by a pleader.\n\n\nSection 302 of CrPC\n\n\n0.0.6 6. Summoning and examining witness\nJudges can call any person as a witness even if prosecutor doesn’t want to present that person as a witness and themselves examine any witness if prosecutor is not “asking the right questions” as per the judge.\n\nSection 311. Power to summon material witness, or examine person present. Any Court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code, summon any person as a witness, or examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or. recall and re- examine any person already examined; and the Court shall summon and examine or recall and re- examine any such person if his evidence appears to it to be essential to the just decision of the case.\n\nSection 311 of CrPC"

But it is clear that there is a huge difference between the on-book production numbers and the consumption estimate. A very large scale of illegal mining seems to be the only reasonable conclusion unless the states for which data is not available (and import, which I guess was absent for the period of study) account for the 3 times higher consumption estimate."

I share some works (essays, surveys, cross-sectional and time series analysis, and randomized-controlled trials) but this is NOT a literature review—it’s just what I’ve read and what I’ve skimmed. I give some theoretical reasons for why some features in certain regulatory regimes might have some effect but it’s not backed by evidence. This is dangerous territory, so read at your own peril!\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, many countries adopted no-fault compensation for workers. This means that employers, except for cases of willful misconduct of employees, have to always compensate employees (barring some exceptions) if they’re injured or they die in an accident at the workplace. The compensation usually covers loss of wages due to the accident and medical expenses but not anything more unlike what the employee might get if they were allowed to sue like pre worker comp days. So it limits but guarantees compensation. Employers usually pay into a state insurance agency based on the size of their workforce, sector and history of injuries. Jason Crawford has an excellent essay, “How factories were made safe” on America’s transition to no-fault compensation based on Mark Aldrich’s “Safety First.” I recommend reading the entire essay but I’m attaching some important excerpts here (emphasis mine)."

Their only recourse was a lawsuit—an expensive proposition, then as now. Payments were often small, sometimes covering only funeral expenses, or not even that. And there were multiple ways employers could escape liability. If the worker had been negligent in any way, this was “contributory negligence,” and the employer was off the hook. By the “fellow servant” rule, if one worker’s injury was the result of another worker’s negligence, the employer was again not liable. Finally, by the doctrine of the “assumption of risk,” the employer was not liable if the accident was considered to be within the expected risks of the job. These defenses together were known as the “unholy trinity,” and because of them, it is estimated that only one employee in eight received compensation after bringing suit against their employer."

The book-length report was a systematic survey of every fatality and hospitalization in Allegheny County from July 1906 to June 1907. Eastman interviewed workers, foremen, superintendents, and the families of the deceased. She described the accidents themselves, the general risks of the factory, and some of the preventative measures that could be taken. She presented statistics on accidents and their causes. The fundamental conclusion of the report was that in the prevention of accidents, whether directly attributable to the employer or not, “the will of the employer is pre-eminently important.” Work accidents should not be attributed to “carelessness,” but to the lack of safety provisions, inspections, warning systems, and training, and also to the long hours and great speed demanded of the workers."

    "text": "3 No-fault system for worker’s compensation\n\nThe new system, however, dramatically increased employers’ costs. The price to a company of a fatal accident was raised from hundreds to a few thousand dollars, and insurance premiums increased in many cases as much as fivefold. Moreover, the no-fault nature of the system shifted companies’ focus from fighting liability, in the case of lawsuits, to preventing injuries. This shift is exactly what needed to happen. With this new focus and new financial incentive, companies began to set up safety departments, staffed by engineers.\n\nSafety engineering became a thing.\n\nThe new corps of safety engineers began fixing the root causes of injuries. They put guards and enclosures around the moving parts of machines. They invented locks for the machines, so that they couldn’t be turned on unless those guards were in place. They created automatic shutoff mechanisms. They added reversing mechanisms to machines to clear jams, so that workers wouldn’t have to reach in and clear them by hand. They designed power levers that pull outwards instead of in, so that if they are accidentally bumped, the machine turns off, instead of turning on. At the Ford Motor Company, safety engineers made improvements to tools, then shared the blueprints with the toolmakers. In time, a market for safe equipment developed, especially as procurement departments started to give preference to tools with safety features. The machines began to come with guards and enclosures standard; eventually, you couldn’t buy tools without them.\nThe engineers added railings to walkways and built viaducts for workers to cross tracks (rather than crossing them at grade). They added more clearance around machines and rails. They redesigned and rebuilt blast furnaces stronger, to prevent hot-metal breakouts. They found safer chemicals to substitute for dangerous ones such as ammonia. They designed safety apparel: safety glasses, protective gloves and leggings, hard hats, steel-toed shoes.\nElectrification in particular was a boon, not only to safety but to factory working conditions in general. Brighter lighting made it easier to see hazards, and getting rid of candles, oil lamps, and gas light reduced smells, fumes, and the risk of fire. Electric motors eliminated the shafts, belts, pulleys and flywheels that had previously distributed power, all of which could trap arms, clothing and hair. No flywheel also meant that a machine could stop immediately rather than taking time to spin down. And electricity allowed the factory to be completely reorganized: no longer confined to the line of the central power shaft, machines could be arranged to optimize the flow of materials. This minimized handling, which improved both productivity and safety.\nEqually important to these engineering fixes were education and training for the workers.\n[…]\n\nCompanies also established or upgraded on-site medical care. Regular checkups also helped: it was discovered that some workers had medical conditions, and should be placed in less physically demanding roles; many others were found to need glasses, and better eyesight improved safety."

Controlling for these factors, however, Aldrich still estimates (p. 164) that safety technology and practices reduced injury rates 3.7%/year from 1926–45, for a total reduction of about 50% over that period."

    "text": "5 Pre-emptive penalties\nI was wondering what might have led to the addition of the more intrusive regulatory regime of having an agency make rules, send inspectors to workplaces and penalize them for not following their rules even before any worker was harmed. In the US, that was the introduction of the “Occupational Safety and Health Administration” (OSHA) in 1970. This didn’t end workers’ compensation but added additional rules, set by bureaucrats, that workplaces had to comply with.\nWorkers’ compensation was based on the idea that, apart from increasing the number of workers who get compensated (who weren’t getting compensated earlier due to the costs of suing their employers), the liability that employers would have to face would compel them to improve workplace safety and focus on worker health. OSHA, intrinsicly, is based on the idea that there exists a bureaucracy that can pre-emptively decide what practices improve workplace safety and enforce them efficiently and neutrally across its jurisdiction. This is was significant shift in the way the regulatory state functioned, so I was wondering what led to the creation of OSHA. Did workplace fatalities rise signficantly again in the years preceeding its creation?\nInterestingly, the article that OSHA’s Wikipedia page cites to claim that, “[i]n the 1960s, increasing economic expansion again led to rising injury rates, and the resulting political pressures led Congress to establish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),” does say so but the data it provides doesn’t show anything like that!\n\nStrange. Anyway, I did some more digging to find evidence on OSHA’s effectiveness and I found John Leeth’s working paper, “OSHA’s Role in Promoting Occupational Safety and Health.” Leeth includes a workplace fatalities time series to show that eyeballing the graph reveals no change in trend.\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nWhen I shared this with Crawford, he shared Scott Alexander’s blogpost on observing change in trends by eyeballing such graphs and specifically this graph. He shows that the timeseries for transistors per microprocessor, which grows exponentially and is famously called “Moore’s Law” (courtesy of Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel and previously Fairchild Semiconductors, who observed this), doesn’t show any change in trend from the time when laser photolithography was invented.\n\nThis, he says, perhaps is because:\n\nPhysical law is consistent with transistors shrinking this quickly. But having noticed this, humans (like the leadership of Intel) commit to achieve it. That commitment functions kind of as a control system. If there’s a big advance in one area, they can relax a little bit in other areas. If there’s a problem in one area, they’ll pour more resources into it until there stops being a problem. One can imagine an event big enough to break the control system – a single unexpected discovery that cuts sizes by a factor of 1000 all on its own, or a quirk of physical law that makes it impossible to fit more transistors on a chip without inventing an entirely new scientific paradigm. But in fact there was no event big enough to break the control system during this period, so the system kept working.\n\nFor a congruent issue, the rate of decrease in air pollution being largely unchanged after the introduction of the Clean Air Act in the US in 1990, he says:\n\nThat is, suppose that as the economy improves and stuff, the American people demand cleaner air. They will only be happy if the air is at least 2% cleaner each year than the year before. If one year the air is 10% cleaner than the year before, environmentalist groups get bored and wander off, and there’s no more progress for the next five years. But if one year the air is only 1% cleaner, newly-energized environmentalist voters threaten to vote out all the incumbents who contributed to the problem, and politicians pass some emergency measure to make it go down another 1%. So absent some event strong enough to overwhelm the system, air pollution will always go down 2% per year. But that doesn’t mean the Clean Air Act didn’t change things! The Clean Air Act was part of the toolkit that the control system used to keep the decline at 2%. If the Clean Air Act had never happened, the control system would have figured out some other way to keep air pollution low, but that doesn’t mean the Clean Air Act didn’t matter. Just that it mattered exactly as much as whatever it would have been replaced with.\nIf this were true, you wouldn’t see the effects of pollution-busting technologies on pollution. You’d see them on everything else. For example, suppose that absent any other progress on air pollution, politicians would regulate cars harder, and that’s what would make air pollution go down by 2% that year. In that case, the effects of inventing an unexpected new pollution-busting technology wouldn’t appear in pollution levels, they would appear in car prices. Unless car prices are also governed by a control system – maybe car companies have a target of keeping costs below $20,000 per car, and so they would skimp on safety in order to bring prices back down, and then the effects of a new anti-pollution technology would appear in car accident fatality rates.\n\nMaybe this is true. Maybe the US government timed the possible increase in workplace fatalities in advance, introduced OSHA and managed the same rate of reduction in workplace fatalities. It doesn’t sound very convincing to me but it’s totally possible.\nLeeth’s paper had much more than this chart though, including a literature review of 17 studies. They were primarily on time series and cross-sectional samples and measured the association of injury rates and inspection rates, citations issued or the existence of the agency. The results range from “no impact” or “insignificant” to modest reductions in injuries. These studies were obviously more sophisticated than just eyeballing that chart but still could be affected from the decision making of the agency.\nWe would need natural experiments or randomized controlled trials to actually establish causality. And I found one study that exploited one of OSHA’s own programs where they randomly assigned inspections on sites selected from a target list of (non-construction) workplaces with ~2-4 times higher than average injury rates based on its survey. The establishments that they inspected, ~80% of the total establishments that were selected in the lottery, had a 4% reduction “in injuries involving days away from work, on average, during the inspection year and following three years.” The finding had a p-value of 0.07, so not statistically significant but still suggestive. The working paper makes additional claims (a higher reduction in injuries) based on adjustments for control group cross-overs. Arnold Ventures, the organization that funded (?) the study, explained this:\n\nThis treatment-on-treated estimate [“treated” = selected by lottery, “treatment” = inspection] is conservative in that it does not adjust for the 24% of establishments not chosen for inspection in a given year that were inspected at some point in the subsequent three years (i.e., control group “cross-overs”). Adjusting for such cross-overs is challenging in an RCT analysis because cross-over inspections generally take place in a later year than treatment group inspections, leading to a different temporal pattern of effects. In their working paper linked above, the researchers report treatment-on-treated estimates that seek to adjust for such cross-overs."

If I did that, I should be subjecting workers’ compensation to the same treatment of an RCT or a natural experiment. I’m just saying that both do have some, but not conclusive, evidence that they might be working—I don’t know if they do work. OSHA is more intrusive and the fact that no-fault compensation only kicks in if there’s an accident without willful misconduct might mean that it generates less false positives but the RCT also finds no effect on business operations, so I’m not sure if one is better than the other, or if either are better than none.\nHowever, there is a fundamental difference in how the workplace safety regulatory regime works differently in the US than in India (and as a side-effect might also give some hints on why such an intrusive regulatory agency might not have any effect on business operations). Yes, we also have no-fault compensation for workers. Yes, we also have inspectors going around telling businesses how to run “safely”. But there’s one fundemental difference in the power that the agency has. In India, businesses can be shut down, if the inspector deems necessary, without a court order.\n\n40.

[…] (2) If it appears to the Inspector that the use of any building or part of a building or any part of the ways, machinery or plant in a factory involves imminent danger to human life or safety, he may serve on 1[the occupier or manager or both] of the factory an order in writing prohibiting its use until it has been properly repaired or altered.\n\nsource: Factories Act, 1948\nYou may go to court to reverse this decision and continue with your work if you get a decision in your favor but your business will be shut until then. The infamous delays of our court system don’t make this super helpful for the employer though. OSHA does NOT have the power close a business or a job site without a court order. This, at least, adds one more independent person, a judge, with veto power over regulatory action—this might lower the probability of wrongful penalization, if their decisions are independent, but maybe cost of lowering true positives.\nThe US also has jury trials, which may add around four to twelve (since there might be less than twelve in civil trials and they don’t require unanimity) more people with veto power (they find the facts and also have a veto over interpretation of law via nullification). I’m not sure if they have jury trials in cases where OSHA goes to court to shut down businesses or when businesses go to court to reverse an OSHA penalty but they might have; I’d be glad if anyone could clarify how their legal system works in this regard. I say this because unfortunately, the institution of trial by jury has been subverted in the US too for certain kinds of cases — especially regulatory agency cases, where internal judges, called “Administrative Law Judges” (ALJs), adjucate cases for the agency. When those cases reach a judge, the judge relies on the agencies’ fact findings — the case never goes to a jury. Refer this paper for a detailed breakdown of the history of the institution and also the recent subversion. In 2022, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in the US held that people have the right to a jury trial even when the SEC (their securities regulator) brings a case in their internal tribunal, so maybe we’ll see a resurgence of the institution in other agency cases in the US soon — but it’s too early to say anything."

It estimates the economic rent by subtracting non-tax expenses, a 20% return on assets and the taxes on that income. This economic rent is around 20 times the royalties collected, i.e. only 5% of the rent was collected via royalties. Most of the rent went to the miner while some of it went to the Central government via taxes. Part of the rent might have also been paid as dividends to the Central government (which owns ~60% of NMDC). Note that royalties from sub-soil mineral are owed to the state government and are defined in law."

The usual argument that is put in favor of downsizing is that soldiers’ salaries and pensions are eating our budget at a time when we need to increase our capital expenditure (primarily buying more/upgrading weapons) and that there is a need to reduce the average age."

Now this is the level at which their (US) Army War College is suggesting partial conscription against Russia-China-Iran-DPRK because they suspect high casualties.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine War is exposing significant vulnerabilities in the Army’s strategic personnel depth and ability to withstand and replace casualties.11 Army theater medical planners may anticipate a sustained rate of roughly 3,600 casualties per day, ranging from those killed in action to those wounded in action or suffering disease or other non-battle injuries.12 With a 25 percent predicted replacement rate, the personnel system will require 800 new personnel each day. For context, the United States sustained about 50,000 casualties in two decades of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In large-scale combat operations, the United States could experience that same number of casualties in two weeks.13\nIn addition to the disciplined disobedience required to execute effective mission command, the US Army is facing a dire combination of a recruiting shortfall and a shrinking Individual Ready Reserve. This recruiting shortfall, nearly 50 percent in the combat arms career management fields, is a longitudinal problem. Every infantry and armor soldier we do not recruit today is a strategic mobilization asset we will not have in 2031.14 The Individual Ready Reserve, which stood at 700,000 in 1973 and 450,000 in 1994, now stands at 76,000.15 These numbers cannot fill the existing gaps in the active force, let alone any casualty replacement or expansion during a large-scale combat operation. The implication is that the 1970s concept of an all-volunteer force has outlived its shelf life and does not align with the current operating environment. The technological revolution described below suggests this force has reached obsolescence. Large-scale combat operations troop requirements may well require a reconceptualization of the 1970s and 1980s volunteer force and a move toward partial conscription.16\n\nsource (emphasis mine)\nThe casualty figures are from FM 4-0.\nThat doesn’t make our (post downsizing to half) number look good. However, there are several confounding factors here, the most important of which is the relative power between the countries, India and US, versus their respected non-China enemies (Pakistan for us while Russia, Iran and DPRK for them). The right way to go about this would be to get to a casualty number for us like the US did for them and then determine the optimal soldier. However, I’m not aware of any such estimation from the government."

Up to 30 for a conventional offense.\nIndia currently has 37 divisions, which is enough for a conventional offense vs Pakistan or a 2 front defensive war, but not both. This fits India’s current doctrine. If India downsizes, it will have to change its doctrine as well. […] I’m assuming a simple 1.0 force coef between India and Pakistan, and an assumption that 10 extra divisions can create a 3:1 force ratio along one corps-sized AOR, which then collapses the Pakistani front in that area and bisects the country as envisioned by Sundarji. Cold Start would have a different force requirement. Not thinking about nukes in this scenario or outside intervention.\n\nThis shows that downsizing to half is not compatible if we want to continue with the doctrine of Cold Start. Downsizing would mean that we would have to change our doctrine as well."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Jason Miklian and Scott Carney’s “Fire in the Hole” published in the Foreign Policy magazine is on India’s Naxalite insurgency but it also discusses illegal coal mining in Jharkhand (since it is a connected issue) and gives us some estimates. Even though I’d recommend the reader to read the entire article, I’m attaching the relevant excerpt here:\n\nKumar comes from a long line of Jharkhandi robber barons. In the 1980s, he used his mining camps as staging grounds for stalking the region’s near-extinct Bengal tigers. Today he owns a series of profitable but (by his own admission) illegal coal mines, hidden in the palm forests. Legal mines extract ore with giant machines that carve craters to the horizon; Kumar’s are more like secret caves, the coal dug out of deep tunnels with pickaxes by day laborers working for $2 to $3 a day. He told us his revenues run about $4 million a year, typical for off-the-books operations in a state where less than half of raw materials are extracted legitimately.\nOn July 4, 2004, Kumar was closing out the day’s accounts in his makeshift office at one of his mines when seven female guerrillas carrying automatic rifles broke down his door, forcing him into the forest at gunpoint. They marched him to a riverbed, where they stopped and held a gun to his head. “I thought I was going to die,” he recalls. Instead they demanded $2.5 million for his ransom.\nThrough the night, the Maoists marched him barefoot over crisscrossing trails, until they happened across a police patrol that was searching for him. Kumar escaped in the ensuing gun battle. But after he returned to work several weeks later, Maoist negotiators knocked on his door and let him know he was still a target. So, Kumar told us, he quickly hashed out a business arrangement with the rebels: In exchange for their leaving his operation alone, he would pay them 5 percent of his revenues.”\nThe protection money, like the small bribes Kumar says he pays to the police to avoid troublesome safety and environmental regulations, has simply become another operating cost. Kumar says that every mine owner he knows pays up, too. By his back-of-the-envelope approximation, if the other estimated 2,500 illegal mines in the state are doling out comparable kickbacks to the rebels, the Maoists’ annual take would come to $500 million — enough to keep a militant movement alive indefinitely. “It works like a tax,” he says with a Cheshire grin, “just another business expense and now everything runs smoothly.”\n\n(emphasis mine)\nThis is roughly inline with the estimates I’ve heard from others. My conversations with some of my acquaintances have taught me that their conversations with their acquaintances and relatives working at mining companies (it is important to note the multiple degrees of separation involved here) reveals that only 1-50% of mining is on-books (being conducted legally), which means that the government isn’t receiving royalties for the rest of the illegal mining (50-99% of total).\nUPDATE (26 November 2022): I acknowledge that such estimates aren’t very reliable, so I plan on looking at multiple other ways to estimate the illegal mining activity taking place. This includes looking at consumption estimates and customs data: If one can exploit any one point in the supply chain to find the actual consumption of a mineral, we’ll have a better sense of the level of illegal mining. For example, estimates of cement consumption can let us know the extent to which illegal riverbed sand mining is taking place. This method might not be successful if a lot of illegally mined minerals end up being exported abroad, since they won’t show up in the consumption estimates. But then we could also look up export and import data to figure out discrepancies. All-in-all, I think, without even reading a page of literature estimating the level of illegal mining, that there can be multiple ways to estimate the levels and I’ll explore each in future posts."

In this post, I’ll share some more findings from Shalini Saksena (2009) on the difference between the economic rent and royalty the government got from oil, gas and coal production in India from 1990 to 2004.\n\n\nFig 1 & 2: From BASU, RAHUL. “Catastrophic Failure of Public Trust in Mining: Case Study of Goa.” Economic and Political Weekly, vol. 50, no. 38, 2015, pp. 44–51.

Maybe it had to do with the sale price of these minerals, or something else. I have a hunch that it has to do with the increasing role of private miners in India but since I haven’t studied that in detail, I would refrain from concluding anything and would reserve this issue for some other post.\nUPDATE (30 March 2023): It is important to note that not all of the difference between resource rent and royalty is privatized. Most of the coal mining and oil & gas extraction in India is done by PSUs who pay regular dividends to their shareholders and whose majority shareholder is the Central government. However, the resource rent is still partly privatized since the Central government owns only ~70-80% of the two major miners, namely Coal India and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. This means that part of the difference between the resource rent and royalty goes to the private investors in these PSUs. In addition, the states are entitled to receive royalty & other payments for sub-soil minerals; however, the part of the resource rent for them is taken by the Central government via dividends.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Rajesh Chadha and Ganesh Sivamani show, in their paper, how the payments that miners would make to the government for the privilege of getting the mining lease, namely auction premia, as bid by the miners themselves, and statutory payments, for auctions held from 2015-16 to April-June 2021-22 are more than the value of the resource estimated by the Ministry of Mines:\n\nI’ve correct a typographical error\n\nA brief primer on auction and statutory payments: The Ministry of Mines conducts electronic forward auctions amongst miners who they’ve “qualified.” They bid on the percentage of their sales based on the Average Selling Price (ASP), published on a monthly-basis by the Indian Bureau of Mines for that grade of ore (calculated as a weighted-average of the sale prices of merchant miners and open market sales of captive miners), that they’ll pay to the state government — this is called the auction premium. In addition to the auction premium, they have to make some statutory payments, which includes the royalty, contributions to the District Mineral Foundation (DMF) and the National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET). The royalty is also paid to the state government, either as a percentage of their sales based on the ASP or some rupees on tonnage-basis, but they are defined in law unlike the auction premium which is the highest bid in the auction. Contribution to the DMF is 10% (for post-2015 auctioned mines) or 30% (pre-2015) of the royalty while for the NMET is 2% of the royalty.\nHere’s a mineral-wise breakdown:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, I think very high (but less than 100%) auction and statutory payments may be rational for captive miners given the high rents in this industry — it’s just that their higher auction bids to secure the mine would have to be less than the higher price that they would have to pay to the merchant miner. But most of these payments combined were too high — more than 100% of the value of the mineral on a weighted-average basis!\nI’m now going to list some of the answers to the obvious question, “Why are the bids so high — to the level of taking the auction and statutory payments more than the value of the resouce?” that I could find in the paper, from this presentation, from my conversations with Rahul Basu and my own premature understanding of the industry.\nThe first reason that both the paper and corresponding presentation stress upon is that captive miners can absorb losses in their downstream businesses.\n\nMost [reasons for overbidding] relate to the security of procuring raw materials. The cost of minerals may only be a small proportion of operations cost for downstream plants, but guaranteeing mineral supply would be important to the producers.\n\nGiven that the cost of iron ore for steel producers is only ~10-15% of the sale price of steel, the increase in price due to the higher auction and statutory payments might not be too much. If, for example, merchant miners mine iron ore at a cost of 50 and sell it at 100, including auction and statutory payments, while captive miners also mine at 50 but sell to their own steel plant at the same price (50) and then pay 100% of the 100 as auction and statutory payments, that totals 150 or 50 more than what merchant miners pay. Furthermore, if iron ore constitutes 10% of the steel’s sale price, then for captive miners, the increase is only 5% of the sale price of their final produce, which they can absorb, in exchange for a more reliable supply of perhaps their most crucial raw material.\nThey also stipulate that bidders expect policy changes in the future and just wanted to secure the mines till then.\nIn addition to these two legal ways, I think there are some ways that can actually make mining, even with obligations to pay auction and statutory payments of 100%+ of ASP, profitable but those ways are illegal. I’m not saying that they do engage in such activities or that they will, just that there are ways, that are illegal, that can be used to make their mining profitable.\nOne way in which such bids make sense is if miners under-report the grade of the ore that is mined and thus pay auction and statutory payments on a lower ASP, like what was recently a suspicion of the Ministry of Mines for manganese mined in Odisha. The price of grades vary drastically, so recording sale of a lower grade while selling a higher grade can be very profitable. For example,\n\nThe price of ore with less than 25% Manganese content is ₹3,228 while the same for ore containing Manganese content over 46 % is ₹20,407.\n\nSecond, miners can make up for the losses by keeping some produce totally off-the-books. This is not unprecedented. Off-the-book sales would not attract any auction premia or royalties and the potential higher profits could make the miner profitable overall. I think there’s no need for collecting payments in cash or through a non-banking channel — one can just setup a company that pretends to do, say “consulting,” and ask the buyer to also get into a contract to take the services of that consulting company (maybe through another company). They would then make the payment to that consulting company. As long as the real mineral reaches the buyer either without the administration’s knowledge or with their unofficial approval (which may or may not be in exchange for stone gray or magenta pieces of paper), everything should proceed smoothly.\nFinally, there is a possibility of widespread under-invoicing of sales throughout the industry that is enough to underestimate the ASP. If the ASP is itself lower than what the actual sale price is for the same ore, mining can be profitable even with auction and statutory payments of 100%+ of ASP."

    "title": "India’s Nuclear Deterrent — Shastri, Indira, Rajiv and Vajpayee",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s a theory that attempts to discredit the four former Prime Ministers–Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee–while being overly sympathetic to P. V. Narasimha Rao for their role in establishing our nuclear deterrent. I’d suggest you read this thread by the anonymous Twitter account @arya_amsha to know what the theory is before reading what I think about it.\nAs I expected while going through the thread, this narrative selectively uses screenshots from Vipin Narang’s book, “Seeking the Bomb: Strategies of Nuclear Proliferation.” I encourage you to read the relevant section from Chapter 3 of the book. For those who do not have access to the book, you can find the relevant chapter here on Imgur.\nHaving read this, you may have already identified some issues with arya_amsha’s interpretations. I will now enumerate the errors I found.\nThe author cites an anonymous source to claim that Indira Gandhi was disinterested in developing a nuclear bomb. However, the author himself acknowledges that the initiatives of Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi in starting the ‘Peaceful Nuclear Explosion’ (PNE) program could well have been a euphemism implying, ‘we also have the capability for a bomb.’ This interpretation aligns with the broader discourse surrounding the PNE during that era. If Indira Gandhi was indeed opposed to the idea of a nuclear bomb, why then did she initiate the development of the Prithvi missile, capable of delivering a nuclear warhead? This contradiction remains unaddressed.\nGranted, India could (and arguably should) have pursued a more assertive nuclear policy. Nevertheless, it is peculiar that arya_amsha extends the benefit of the doubt to P. V. Narasimha Rao for not conducting nuclear tests–despite possessing the capability–citing unsubstantiated (in my view) claims of a frail economy in 1994, compared to 1998 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee authorized the tests. The onus is on the author and/or arya_amsha to substantiate claims regarding the economic conditions of the respective years. I am not trained in economics, I’ve only eyeballed some charts on World Bank’s website, namely GDP per capita growth, unemployment, inflation and current account balance, net trade in goods and servives, net financial account and foreign exchange reserves for our balance of payments situation, and I don’t notice much of a difference.\nEven if we were to accept the premise that the economy was weaker in 1994 than in 1998, it is inconsistent for arya_amsha not to afford the same consideration to Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, and Rajiv Gandhi. They too faced the threat of sanctions but collectively achieved a state of readiness for a nuclear test within 100 days, initiated efforts to reduce this to just three days, and developed the Prithvi & Agni missiles for nuclear delivery, as Vipin Narang himself acknowledges.\nAnother excuse for not criticizing P. V. Narasimha Rao’s inaction posits that when he was ‘set to test,’ the Americans discovered the plan, contacted him, and publicized the attempt to discourage it. However, this argument loses credibility for several reasons. Both Vajpayee and Narasimha Rao were aware of the potential repercussions of a nuclear test, regardless of American knowledge. Yet, one proceeded while the other abstained. Furthermore, the Americans themselves lacked concrete evidence of India, under Rao’s administration, contemplating a nuclear test. For more context, refer to this article from The National Security Archive at The George Washington University.\nConsidering all these factors, I am inclined to believe that the only plausible explanation is a lack of resolve on P. V. Narasimha Rao’s part, in contrast to Vajpayee’s determination."

    "title": "Is MiG-21 really the ‘flying coffin’?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "TLDR: I think we need more empirical evidence than we have currently although there may be design choices that are apparent to someone with technical know-why that I don’t have.\nThe Indian news media comfortably describes the MiG-21, specifically and no other aircraft, as a “flying coffin”. It is a term used pejoratively for an aircraft that has a poor safety track record due to specific aspects of design and engineering. There are several reasons for which one may believe the MiG-21 has a poor safety record because of its vintage design.\nRajat Pandit writes in the Times of India\n\nWithout modern systems like FADEC (full authority digital electronic controls) and mission computers, the ageing MiG-21s also have the highest landing and take-off speed in the world at 340 mph.\n\nHe also attributes the poor safety record to issues not related to the design of the aircraft but\n\ninadequate training to rookie pilots, shoddy maintenance and poor quality control of spares.\n\nu/barath_s as adds that since it is a single engine aircraft, it does not have\n\n[…] much backup in case of bird strike or fuel line manufacturing flaw.\n\nRetired squadran leader and jaguar pilot Vijainder Kumar Thakur believes,\n\n[…] the number of sorties flown has an impact on the accident rate. For every 200 flight hour, the MiG 21 likely logs double the number of landings as compared to Mirage, because of the MiG’s much lower endurance.\n\nWhile there are many reasons one might consider it to be a safe candidate for being termed as a flying coffin, I think anyone studying this issue seriously should be asking two questions: 1) Is there any empirical basis to believe that MiG-21’s accident frequency is higher than other aircraft in IAF’s fleet? 2) How many of MiG-21’s excess accidents when compared with other aircraft in IAF’s fleet are not explained by confounding factors like their aggregate flying hours, flight conditions, differential training/maintenance/spare part quality or due to some unexplainable reason other than the design (random variation)?\nI did some calculations on some not-so-reliable numbers to find out accident rate of IAF’s fleet. I sourced data mainly from Bharat Rakshak’s database (accidents, census) but also from Wikipedia (historical, active) and a couple of other secondary sources (India Today and WION). Here is the spreadsheet with all figures and corresponding sources. These charts illustrate some of the results:\n\nIt should be pretty obvious that one shouldn’t compare aircraft by their raw accident numbers since they contribute to the IAF fleet in different proportions. So the next obvious number to look at would be the census (present and historical) of each of these aircrafts in IAF.\n\nIt’s clear that those aircraft which had more accidents also form a larger part of IAF’s fleet. To know by how much, we can find what percentage are accidents of their census.\n\nMiG-21’s accident rate, considering India Today’s accident figure, puts it significantly higher than other MiGs and also the Mirage 2000 for sure, 15 to 39% higher than other MiGs and 84% higher than Mirage 2000, while if I consider BRF’s it is -6 to 13% higher than other MiGs and 40% higher than the Mirage 2000 (so not that different from other MiGs per BRF’s). But something more important to note here is that the last chart, which plots accident rate, is much more flatter than the first one, which plotted number of accidents. It is also interesting to note that such discrepancies exist among other aircrafts too. For example, it seems that the Su-30 has similar number of accidents (11) as the Mirage 2000 (13), even though IAF has 5 times Su-30s as Mirage 2000s. Moreover, if someone was being honest they would call the entire fleet of IAF a flying coffin except Su-30.\nThere are several other confounding factors that I listed earlier for which data in unavailable and so can’t be used to adjust the accident rate or be privy to the entire context. Amongst the factors I listed earlier, aggregate flying hours and flight conditions would not be available due to security reasons possibly (or some other reason I’m not aware of) and differential training/maintenance/spare part quality is not quantifiable. In the absence of this, in my view, vital information, I believe it would be 1) inappropriate to conclude that there are empirical reasons to believe that MiG-21’s higher accident rate is due to its vintage design even though there may be theoretical reasons to believe that and 2) impossible to find out how many of those excess accidents are attributable to its design. However, it is clear that most of MiG-21’s accidents can be explained by the fact that it contributes more to IAFs fleet: 25% of Mirage 2000s and 35% of MiG-29s have ended up in accidents while this figure for MiG-21s sits at 46%, considering India Today’s accident figure (which is more recent), and 35%, considering BRF’s. All other aircraft except Su-30, Hart and Audax are also in that range."

It describes a progression that began with manually drawing a blueprint of a component and interpreting it, followed by operating machine tools with human sensory feedback. Starting in the 1960s, this process transitioned to drawing and interpreting blueprints, then programming numerical control (NC) machines by feeding them a perforated tape with instructions, with the NC machine performing the machining. In the 1970s, this evolved into the use of computer numeric control (CNC) machines. Finally, in the 1990s, with the development of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software, the process further advanced to creating drawings using CAD software, converting these drawings into instructions for the CNC machine using CAM, and having the CNC machine execute the machining. Each step improved accuracy while also reducing the need for a highly specialized workforce built by passing knowledge from senior workers to juniors through apprenticeship.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Production chain of the missiles that S400 fires\nSubstack (not behind a paywall)\nEven though the post is on why Russia is winning the war in Ukraine, it’s more of a brief introduction to the production chain of the missiles that Russia’s S400 missile system fires.\n\nCasting - pour molten metal into a mould/die. This step is totally manual.\nPressing, forging, stamping - shape the metal with compressive force to increase its strength or give it a desired form. THis process utilizes machines but they’re fairly old and (I guess) not computer-controlled.\nMachining - further remove unwanted material from the pressing-foreging-stamping stage using lathes, milling and drilling machines, etc. This stage is most affected from the transition to digital control, which also leads to asymmetric power among countries, a factor that can be exploited.\nCoating - to cover it with a layer to prevent corrosion, increase surface strength or reduce friction, etc. It encompasses a broad range of processes, some of which are automated, while others are not.\nAssembly, wiring - the least automated\n\nIt’s not behind a paywall and includes video clips showing all processes listed below, so I’d recommend watching them and reading the entire post. The clips have been taken from this video.\nIn a recent Twitter thread, he shared a graph illustrating the difference in importance of various stages in the production processes of the Sineva SLBM at KrasMash.\n\nI don’t know what the y-axis is. My best guess would be that it’s either time taken by each process or the cost. I think it being time is more probable.\n\n\n1.3 Asymmetric geographical distribution of machine tools production\nSubstack (behind a paywall)\nThe assymetric geographical distribution of machine tools production makes it a strategic chokepoint, given its importance in manufacturing weapon systems and other essential goods in the modern economy. The following figures from the piece effectively capture these regional disparities. (Note that it’s clearly visible in all of the figures that India has a very high dependence for machine tools but also that countries like China and Russia, which are also perceived as military behemoths by some, aren’t in a very good position either.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh capacity\nLimited capacity\n\n\n\n\nHigh capability\nWestern Europe, Japan\nUnited States, United Kingdom\n\n\nLimited capability\nTaiwan, South Korea, China (heavily limited)\nMost industrial countries"

Alongside complexity, the importance of that industry for those dominated by that mafia influences whether that industry would even exist in that country in the first place. This explains why, for example, cartels control the entire avocado production in Mexico but not something complex — for something more complex, nerds will have to be accomodated and they pose a threat of replacing the mafia in the dominance hierarchy. In the context of Russia, President Putin’s close associates exert significant control over relatively simple extractive industries. This stands in contrast to the more complex industry of producing mining machines, which is primarily led by nerds who’re lower in the hierarchy and distanced from the administration.\n\nIn the mining business, those at the top of the hierarchy, who dominate the industry, rely on machines produced by those lower in the hierarchy. As a result, they allow these lower-tier operators to continue their operations, as disrupting their supply of critical equipment would be detrimental. This situation can be exploited, for instance, by resorting to importing machines — leading to a loss of business for those lower in the hierarchy and potentially push them even further down. The rise of nerds in the hierarchy is detrimental to the mafia, so they’ll do whatever it takes to prevent that from happening."

Galeev employs the food chain analogy to explain that certain critical technologies, such as machine tools, may constitute a small percentage of the GDP or exports but are crucial for manufacturing consumer goods and weapon systems. These technologies are at the top of global supply chain even though they constitute a small percentage of the global GDP. This also happens in the animal kingdom, where, as you go higher in the food chain, the aggregate mass of the level drops, for example, in terms of aggregate mass, all the grass on Earth is heavier than all the herbivores, which are heavier than all the carnivores.\n\n\n3.2 China’s chokepoints (I guess it’s safe to assume that all would also be India’s chokepoints)\nAn article that Galeev often cites, but did not write himself, is “Chokepoints” on “China’s Self-Identified Strategic Technology Import Dependencies” by Georgetown University’s CSET. This article describes China’s self-identified import dependencies as published in a Chinese state-affiliated newspaper Science and Technology Daily. These range from photo-lithography machines (a more well-known chokepoint for China given the sanctions imposed by the US in the recent past) to aviation design software​ — a total of 35 technologies. This spreadsheet, attached in the article’s Appendix, contains a list of the technologies, leading global providers, the PRC providers, China’s difficulties, its catch-up efforts, and experts and papers cited."

I don’t need to show any data on this–everyone knows this and there is no dispute on this. Death is an old person’s problem and Covid deaths are also an old person’s problem. If your chances of dying were 1% this year and then in a few days I come back and say, “Sorry, now they’re 1.2%,” will you stop going to office, close yourself in a house, temporarily withdraw your child (whose death rate also went up by the same ratio)? I hope you don’t.\nThis is exactly what happened in March 2020. For example, of the first 803 deaths (not cases) that happened in Italy, only 2 happened in people below the age of 50, 0 below the age of 30:\n Original image translated to English using Google Lens\nAfter a few days, in “No, Covid 19 is not an old person problem”, he elaborates by giving the exact age-wise data and then adds some commentary on the consequences of not reacting in an ultra-precautionary way.\n\n\n\nFig 1- Multiplier of the Force of Mortality Across Age Groups &gt;30, Nov. 2021, annualized. For the youth the ratio is both lower and much more unstable owing the rarity of both death and death from COVID.\n\nThe x-axis of the graph starts at age 30 and not 0.\nNow, on the consequences he writes:\n\nIf Covid is an old person problem, deserving to be ignored on that account, let’s treat cardiology, oncology, urology, and most of internal medicine in the same manner.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n“Deserved to be ignored”? Well, no one is arguing that you should ignore Covid. The most common argument from the side opposed to Taleb is that we should have no lockdowns, no school closures, etc. There is no loss of civil liberties in practicing “cardiology, oncology, urology, and most of internal medicine”, so people aren’t reacting to them in the way they are against covid lockdowns–as simple as that."

    "section": "2 Cross checking Free A Billion",
    "text": "2 Cross checking Free A Billion\nA few years ago, the Central government actually came up with a figure of how much land 41 of their 51 ministries and 22 of over 300 PSEs they own, and it was 13,505 square kilometers. For reference, the total area of Delhi is 1,483 square kilometers. So the Central government owns land equal to ~9 Delhi’s. Note that the 13,505 square kilometer figure given by the government still misses 10 Union ministries, some MoD land (for security reasons), more than 280 Central PSEs and all the land owned by State governments, so total government land will be more than 13,505 square kilometers.\nFor context, Free A Billion gave sources for 383,331 acres of surplus land belonging to the Central government. That comes out to be around 1551 square kilometers, which is around 11.5% of the total land declared by the Central government.\nNow The Hindu reports that according to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India:\n\nThe Ministries of Railways and Defence, respectively, have 43,000 hectares and 32,780 hectares of land lying vacant, without even any proposed use […] the 13 major port trusts have 14,728 hectares of land lying idle.\n\n\nsource: The Hindu\nTo be consistent with the units I have been using, the Ministry of Railways has 430 square kilometers, Ministry of Defense has 327.8 square kilometers and the port trusts have 147.28 square kilometers of idle land. This totals to 905.08 square kilometers, or 6.7% of total declared land of the Central government (13,505 square kilometers). This is a little more than half of the surplus land for which Free A Billion gave its sources. I couldn’t find enough time to dig through CAG reports to find if it has figures for surplus land under other departments. I might do it for a future post but there are reasons to believe that Free A Billion isn’t overestimating the total surplus land (rather underestimating):\nWe can convert the surplus land of the Port Trusts (of 13 major ports I believe) given in hectares to acres. It comes out to be ~35,968 acres. But Free A Billion identified only 27,379 acres as surplus. If we visit their page on Port Trusts, we can see that they have given a breakdown for 10 ports, so it is possible that the rest of the surplus land identified by CAG is either of the remaining 3 (major) ports or some extra in any of these 10 ports. But what is clear is that that Free A Billion could be underestimating the total surplus land."

    "text": "3 Value of the surplus land\nUsing the figures for which Free A Billion have given sources, we can calculate the average value of land. It comes out to be ~Rs. 4,100 per square feet for Central government land identified and ~Rs. 4,300 per square feet for State government land identified excluding Odisha Revenue Board. I excluded Odisha Revenue Board because it is an outlier since has more than 50% of the total land identified but is valued at much less than 1% of the total value but if you include it, the value of State government land will be ~Rs. 700 per square feet.\nIf I take the average value of surplus government land to be Rs. 4,000 (which seems reasonable), the Central and State governments would have to own ~7,800 square kilometers to get the total value of surplus government land at Rs. 340 lakh crore. This is around 8 times the surplus land identified by CAG and around 2 times the surplus land for which Free A Billion have given sources including Odisha Revenue Board but 4 times if we exclude Odisha Revenue Board. It is possible that the appraisal method that is used for Odisha Revenue Board land is not accurate, in which case it would not be an outlier. I haven’t studied the appraisal methods used for different plots in different states and so I can’t comment on it right now. It may be a topic of discussion in a future post.\nBut for a moment I just want to put the 4,160 square kilometers of surplus land that Free A Billion has given sources for in context. This is roughly equal to 4500 crore square feet, or around 45 square per adult. If we take FSI to be 3, it translates to around 135 square feet of constructed area per adult. If the government leased all this surplus land, collected rent on it and distributed that rent equally amongst all adults, each adult will get a rent for around 135 square feet (or more or less depending on FSI).\nUPDATE (30 June 2023): I contacted one of the directors of Free A Billion Pvt. Ltd. to figure out how have they come up with the figure of Rs. 340 lakh crore but their response wasn’t satisfactory. Here’s the exchange of emails I had with them:\n\nI should have actually written mineral reserves of ~Rs. 5000e12 and not ~1001e12, because Rs. 1001e12 is supposed to be the resource rent paid to the government for that amount of reserves according to them but that’s not relevant for this post.\n\nI’ve redacted Kumar Anand’s email ID and phone number but not Rajesh’s (the director) email ID because it was openly available on the internet.\n\n\n\nI did not receive any response to my last email.\nThe dataset I mentioned in my first email is available here and the .csv file I attached to my last email is TOTAL_NATURAL_RESOURCE_RENTS.csv."

    "text": "Sometime back, I had posted What does the military history literature say about the effectiveness of civilian ownership of firearms in both preventing and defending invasions ? on r/WarCollege and also on r/progun and received some good replies. I’d suggest you read both threads. I couldn’t find any literature on widespread ownership of firearms helping civilians defending against invasions but recently, I found a great (but incomplete) manuscript, Carroll Quigley’s Weapon Systems and Political Stability: A History (pdf), that studies the history of mankind since pre-historic period till the 20th century (even though the book only covers the history till 1500 AD because Quigley died while he was preparing his manuscript) and concludes that “the dominance of democracy in the 20th century is attributable to the acceptance in the 19th century of a weapons system that favored democracy, the hand gun and rifle.”\nAn excerpt from his other book Tragedy and Hope (pdf) on the same topic:\n\nOn the military level in Western Civilization in the twentieth century the chief development has been a steady increase in the complexity and the cost of weapons. When weapons are cheap to get and so easy to use that almost anyone can use them after a short period of training, armies are generally made up of large masses of amateur soldiers. Such weapons we call “amateur weapons,” and such armies we might call “mass armies of citizen-soldiers.” The Age of Pericles in Classical Greece and the nineteenth century in Western Civilization were periods of amateur weapons and citizen-soldiers. But the nineteenth century was preceded (as was the Age of Pericles also) by a period in which weapons were expensive and required long training in their use. Such weapons we call “specialist” weapons. Periods of specialist weapons are generally periods of small armies of professional soldiers (usually mercenaries). In a period of specialist weapons the minority who have such weapons can usually force the majority who lack them to obey; thus a period of specialist weapons tends to give rise to a period of minority rule and authoritarian government. But a period of amateur weapons is a period in which all men are roughly equal in military power, a majority can compel a minority to yield, and majority rule or even democratic government tends to rise. The medieval period in which the best weapon was usually a mounted knight on horseback (clearly a specialist weapon) was a period of minority rule and authoritarian government. Even when the medieval knight was made obsolete (along with his stone castle) by the invention of gunpowder and the appearance of firearms, these new weapons were so expensive and so difficult to use (until 1800) that minority rule and authoritarian government continued even though that government sought to enforce its rule by shifting from mounted knights to professional pikemen and musketeers. But after 1800, guns became cheaper to obtain and easier to use. By 1840 a Colt revolver sold for $27 and a Springfield musket for not much more, and these were about as good weapons as anyone could get at that time. Thus, mass armies of citizens, equipped with these cheap and easily used weapons, began to replace armies of professional soldiers, beginning about 1800 in Europe and even earlier in America. At the same time, democratic government began to replace” authoritarian governments (but chiefly in those areas where the cheap new weapons were available and local standards of living were high enough to allow people to obtain them).\n\nI also posted this excerpt on r/WarCollege. The top comment seems to be erroneous. I think by specialist and amateur weapons, Quigley didn’t mean to say that the specialist weapons were more complex in terms of their manufacturing or their working mechanism but that they required specialist men to use them. A weapon that is more complex than a spear is a rifle but the rifle is much easier to use, yet much more accurate, than a spear for any common guy on the street who doesn’t have the physical strength and training that spears require. Any other more complex weapons, like a supersonic cruise missile, for instance, are practically useless for maintaining internal order and hence don’t factor in when the question of the system of government is asked/answered."

    "text": "2 The proposal\nThe idea behind this process is very simple. To generate the seed, a fair (say 8-sided) die is rolled a very large number of times (on the order of 100-1000 times). The sequence of numbers thus generated is fed to a suitable hash function such as SHA-512 for a large number of rounds2. During this process, independent watchers are physically present, and the generated numbers are also publically broadcast. Since the result of each roll is a discrete, easily readable number, there is no ambiguity.\nAs long as the die is rolled with sufficient randomness, it is practically impossible to determine the generated sequence ahead of time. For an 8-sided die rolled 100 times, the resulting sequence has 300 bits of entropy with \\(8^{100}\\) (\\(\\approx 10^{90}\\)) distinct sequences possible. Despite that, once a sequence is obtained and passed through some large number of rounds of SHA-512, the resulting value obtained is unambiguous and can be easily computed by anyone who observed the experiment.\nThere are many ways that this seed can then be used to (for instance) select questions from a large repository quickly and verifiably, either by seeding a pseudo random number generator or even simply repeatedly applying SHA-512 and using a subset of the bits."

In the extreme case, it is possible to design a machine that could roll the die with enough precision to where it is possible to generate an arbitrary random-looking but actually predetermined sequence using the die. Thus, it is imperative that the experiment is performed by a human (or preferably multiple humans), and regulations are placed on the height and landing surface of the roll to ensure randomness.\nAs long as the experiment is performed by a human for a sufficient number of tries and a sufficient difficulty of getting specific values, it will become practically impossible to obtain a predetermined sequence. Due to the use of SHA-512, even a single roll being a little off will generate a completely different seed value courtesy of the avalanche effect. As long as it’s infeasible for a human to land every single roll on a predetermined value, this attack vector is not a concern.\nThe die itself also needs to be independently verified to not be able to assist a malicious roller in obtaining a specific sequence. This shouldn’t be too hard, as modifications which significantly alter its behaviour can be easily detected. Subtle changes will not provide enough advantage to overcome the difficulty of rolling a predetermined sequence.\nA way to make any sort of manipulation difficult would be to have all 100s or 1000s of dice dropped at once (not sequentially) on a cartesian plane and the sequence could be determined in increasing order of the sum of the x and y-coordinates of the spots the dice land with dead heats being resolved by giving priority to either of the coordinates as pre-decided (rbraalih, 2023)."
